In contrast, both the\ncommon and protopore gates open upon depolarization\nand do not show drastic differences in gating kinetics at\nphysiological voltages with slow and fast time constants\nthat differ by less than roughly a factor of 5 and are smaller\nthan 100 ms (8, 720, 721, 739). Hence, more sophisticated\nanalysis is needed to distinguish both gates in ClC-1 (8,\n739), which can be affected differentially by myotonic mu-\ntations. The voltage dependence of both gates contributes\nto the outward recti\ufb01cation of macroscopic currents. ClC-1\nis ~40% open at resting voltages of skeletal muscle (894)\nand can be opened further by depolarization.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins).

Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore.

Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

(Suppl Fig.\u00a07), an alternative or concurrent mechanism that might have explained the cur-\nrent density increase after ionomycin application. Removal of the first transmembrane domain of Ano4 (Ano4-1-\n1150del-GFP) led to a significant reduction of both membrane localization (as demonstrated by a reduction of the \nPCC between pan Cadherin and Ano4) and density of Ca2+-evoked currents (Fig.\u00a01H\u2013J).

The rather small \ncurrent density increases in cells transfected with GFP-tagged full length Ano4 (less than 3 fold) compared to \ntransfection with untagged Ano4 (more than 25 fold, Fig.\u00a01C) might be explained by the GFP tag hampering or \ninterfering with channel activity.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore.

Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

Moreover, we show\nthat the intrinsically disordered linker between the transmembrane helices twelve and thir-\nteen (IDR5) is required for the activation of PIEZO2 by cytoskeleton-transmitted forces. The\ndeletion of IDR5 abolishes PIEZO2-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth, while it only\npartially affected its sensitivity to cell indentation and does not alter its stretch sensitivity.\nThus, we propose that PIEZO2 is a polymodal mechanosensor that detects different types of\nmechanical stimuli via different force transmission pathways, which highlights the importance\nof utilizing multiple complementary assays when investigating PIEZO function.",

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role.

The majority of these\nreceptors are comprised of (cid:2)1, (cid:4)2, and (cid:3)2 subunits. The\namygdala, a structure involved in processing emotional stimuli,\nexpresses (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits at high levels. The effect of these\nsubunits on GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission is not\nknown. Understanding the influence of these subunits on\nGABAAR-mediated synaptic currents may help in identifying\nthe roles and locations of amygdala synapses that contain these\nsubunits. Here, we describe the biophysical and synaptic prop-\nerties of pure populations of (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 and\n(cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 GABAARs.

Synaptic currents revealed a different pattern\nof activation and deactivation to that of macropatch data. The\ninclusion of (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits slowed both the activation and\ndeactivation rates, suggesting that receptors containing these\nsubunits cluster more diffusely at synapses. Switching the intra-\ncellular domains of the (cid:3)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits substantiated this\ninference.

The majority of these\nreceptors are comprised of (cid:2)1, (cid:4)2, and (cid:3)2 subunits. The\namygdala, a structure involved in processing emotional stimuli,\nexpresses (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits at high levels. The effect of these\nsubunits on GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission is not\nknown. Understanding the influence of these subunits on\nGABAAR-mediated synaptic currents may help in identifying\nthe roles and locations of amygdala synapses that contain these\nsubunits. Here, we describe the biophysical and synaptic prop-\nerties of pure populations of (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 and\n(cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 GABAARs. Their synaptic properties were examined in\nengineered synapses, whereas their kinetic properties were\nstudied using rapid agonist application, and single channel\nrecordings. All macropatch currents activated rapidly (<1 ms)\nand deactivated as a function of the (cid:2)-subunit, with (cid:2)2-contain-\ning GABAARs consistently deactivating (cid:2)10-fold more slowly.\nSingle channel analysis revealed that the slower current decay of\n(cid:2)2-containing GABAARs was due to longer burst durations at\nlow GABA concentrations, corresponding to a (cid:2)4-fold higher\naffinity for GABA. Synaptic currents revealed a different pattern\nof activation and deactivation to that of macropatch data. The\ninclusion of (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits slowed both the activation and\ndeactivation rates, suggesting that receptors containing these\nsubunits cluster more diffusely at synapses. Switching the intra-\ncellular domains of the (cid:3)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits substantiated this\ninference. Because this region determines post-synaptic local-\nization, we hypothesize that GABAARs containing (cid:3)1 and (cid:3)2 use\ndifferent mechanisms for synaptic clustering.",

The GABRD data presented in this study might\nexplain this conundrum. d Subunits are associated with b3 subunits\nin many brain regions; hence, we speculate that the observed hyper-\nsensitivity reaction to vigabatrin in the gain-of-function GABRB3\npatients was caused by further exacerbation of already elevated tonic\nGABAergic currents. Interestingly, one of the two GABRB3 variants,\np.T287I, is paralogue to p.T291I in GABRD, which was found in the\nfamily with intractable absence epilepsy and mild to moderate intel-\nlectual disability. None of the three family members have tried viga-\nbatrin, however, as this drug should not be prescribed to patients\nwith GABRD gain-of-function variants. Furthermore, we propose that\ndrugs that increase GABAergic tone, such as benzodiazepines and\nneurosteroids, should be avoided in patients with gain-of-function\nGABAAR variants or loss-of-function GABA transporter variants.",

The majority of these\nreceptors are comprised of (cid:2)1, (cid:4)2, and (cid:3)2 subunits. The\namygdala, a structure involved in processing emotional stimuli,\nexpresses (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits at high levels. The effect of these\nsubunits on GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission is not\nknown. Understanding the influence of these subunits on\nGABAAR-mediated synaptic currents may help in identifying\nthe roles and locations of amygdala synapses that contain these\nsubunits. Here, we describe the biophysical and synaptic prop-\nerties of pure populations of (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)2, (cid:2)1(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 and\n(cid:2)2(cid:4)2(cid:3)1 GABAARs. Their synaptic properties were examined in\nengineered synapses, whereas their kinetic properties were\nstudied using rapid agonist application, and single channel\nrecordings. All macropatch currents activated rapidly (<1 ms)\nand deactivated as a function of the (cid:2)-subunit, with (cid:2)2-contain-\ning GABAARs consistently deactivating (cid:2)10-fold more slowly.\nSingle channel analysis revealed that the slower current decay of\n(cid:2)2-containing GABAARs was due to longer burst durations at\nlow GABA concentrations, corresponding to a (cid:2)4-fold higher\naffinity for GABA. Synaptic currents revealed a different pattern\nof activation and deactivation to that of macropatch data. The\ninclusion of (cid:2)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits slowed both the activation and\ndeactivation rates, suggesting that receptors containing these\nsubunits cluster more diffusely at synapses. Switching the intra-\ncellular domains of the (cid:3)2 and (cid:3)1 subunits substantiated this\ninference. Because this region determines post-synaptic local-\nization, we hypothesize that GABAARs containing (cid:3)1 and (cid:3)2 use\ndifferent mechanisms for synaptic clustering.",

The M2\u2013M3 loop of\nour strychnine-bound GlyRa3 is much closer to the pore centre than in\napo-GluCl structure (Fig. 4b). Pro275 of the M2\u2013M3 loop is 7.1 A\u02da from\nThr54 of the b1\u2013b2 loop in the strychnine-bound GlyRa3 structure\nwhile the equivalent distance is 4.9 A\u02da between Pro268 and Val45 in the\napo-GluCl structure (Fig. 4c), suggesting that the M2\u2013M3 loop in\nGlyRa3 is pulled even more towards the pore than in apo-GluCl.\nSimilar movement of the M2\u2013M3 loop and the b1\u2013b2 loop upon\nstrychnine binding has also been observed in molecular dynamics\nsimulations of a homology model of GlyRa1 (ref. 30). This could lead\nto more energetic stabilization of the untilting of the M2 helix and the\nclosing of the pore. Therefore, we hypothesize that the binding of the\nantagonist strychnine to GlyRa3 induces the opening of loop C and\nthe orthosteric binding pocket, which further facilitates the inward\ndisplacement of the M2\u2013M3 loop and the tilting of the M2 helix\ntowards the pore, ultimately leading to closing of the channel pore\n(Fig. 5).",

In the antagonized state of GlyRa3, all five M2\nhelices are straight and oriented parallel to the pore axis (Fig. 3a). In\ncontrast, in the apo structure of GluCl8 and the agonist-bound struc-\ntures of GluCl5 and GABAAR6, the M2 helices tilt outwards at the pore\napex (Fig. 3b, c). The GlyRa3\u2013strychnine M2 helices are 11.0 A\u02da apart at\nthe apex (Ala272), 11.7 A\u02da at the base, and 13.0 A\u02da at the most con-\nstricted point (Leu261), averaging the distance between Ca carbons of\ni and i 1 2 protein subunits. In comparison, the apo-GluCl pore is\n12.6 A\u02da at the apex (Ser265), 10.3 A\u02da at the base (Pro243), and 12.5 A\u02da at\nthe most constricted point (Leu254). This corresponds to an ,4u tilt of\nthe M2 helix towards the pore axis in the strychnine-bound state\n(Fig. 4a)8. Transition from the apo- to the agonist-bound state of\nGluCl involves tilting of M2 helix by ,8u away from the pore axis,\nwhich relieves the occlusion of the pore by Leu254 (ref. 5).",

ASIC gating occurs on a \nmillisecond time scale8 and can be largely described by a simple mechanism composed of three \nstates: high pH resting, low pH open and low pH desensitized9. While previously solved x-ray \nstructures of ASIC1a elucidated the conformations of the open10 and desensitized1,11 states, the \nstructure of the high pH, resting state as well as detailed mechanisms for activation and \ndesensitization have remained elusive. Here we present resting state structures of homotrimeric \nchicken ASIC1a at high pH determined by x-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron \nmicroscopy, informing a comprehensive molecular mechanism for proton-dependent gating in \nASICs. In the resting state, the thumb domain has moved outward relative to its position in the \nopen and desensitized states, expanding the \u2018acidic pocket\u2019. Activation thus involves \u2018closure\u2019 of \nthe thumb into the acidic pocket, expansion of the lower palm domain and an iris-like opening of \nthe channel gate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the \u03b211-\u03b212 linkers demarcating upper and \nlower palm domains serve as a molecular \u2018clutch\u2019, undergoing a simple rearrangement to permit \nrapid desensitization.",

The\nsystematic analysis of ENaC single-channel gating kinet-\nics reveals that the open probability (Po) of the channel\nvaries from (cid:3)0.1 to 0.9 and that active ENaC channels can\nbe divided basically into two groups: one with a low Po\nand long closed times and the second with high Po and\nlong open times. These variations in the ENaC Po likely\nre\ufb02ect different channel gating modes (193). Presently it\nis not clear how these gating modes are in\ufb02uenced by\nextracellular and intracellular factors. For instance, ex-\nternal Na(cid:1) decreases channel activity by a mechanism\ntermed \u201cself-inhibition.\u201d The physiological role of this\nNa(cid:1)-induced channel inhibition is not clear, but it could\nplay a role in maintaining a homogeneous Na(cid:1) reabsorp-\ntion along the nephron (87, 184). Intracellular pH, Ca2(cid:1)\n(35, 191), or Na(cid:1) exert a feedback inhibition on the chan-\nnel (1, 62, 80, 136, 191, 227). Finally, enzymes such as\nserine proteases or channel activating protein (CAP)-1\nthat are expressed in tight epithelia stimulate channel\nactivity when coexpressed with ENaC in Xenopus oo-\ncytes (254, 262). This activation of ENaC is also observed\nin Xenopus oocytes after addition of a low concentration\n(2 (cid:5)g/ml) of trypsin to the extracellular side (46). The\nphysiological relevance of the serine proteases in ENaC\nregulation is still unknown.",

Here we\nidentify a family of neuronal Ca2(cid:1)-binding proteins as high-af\ufb01nity\nprotein agonists of the InsP3R, which bind to the channel and\nactivate gating in the absence of InsP3. CaBP/caldendrin, a sub-\nfamily of the EF-hand-containing neuronal calcium sensor family of\ncalmodulin-related proteins, bind speci\ufb01cally to the InsP3-binding\nregion of all three InsP3R channel isoforms with high af\ufb01nity (Ka (cid:1)\n25 nM) in a Ca2(cid:1)-dependent manner (Ka (cid:1) 1 (cid:2)M). Binding activates\nsingle-channel gating as ef\ufb01caciously as InsP3, dependent on func-\ntional EF-hands in CaBP.

Pore-lining inner helices\nthat contain the gating hinge in the MthK channel correspond\nto the sixth membrane-spanning segment of the IP3R. It is of\ninterest to note that a glycine residue is also present within the\nsixth membrane-spanning segment of all three types of the\nIP3R. This structural similarity suggests that the channel gate\nis formed by the sixth membrane-spanning helix of the IP3R.\nOne of the striking differences between the IP3R and other\nligand-gated channels with six membrane-spanning segments,\nsuch as cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, is in the location of\nthe ligand-binding site. Both the IP3-binding site and the Ca2(cid:1)-\nbinding sites are positioned on the N-terminal side of the trans-\nmembrane domain of the IP3R, whereas in other ligand-gated\nchannels, the ligand-binding sites are located in the C-terminal\ncytoplasmic region that is close to the pore-lining inner helices.\nIn these ligand-gated channels, the ligand-binding signals may\nbe transferred directly to the pore domain and cause bending of\nthe inner helices to open the channels.

An ion conduction\npore has been proposed to be located in the hydrophobic seg-\nment between the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions (10,\n11). The primary sequence of the transmembrane domain ad-\njacent to the pore-forming segment is highly homologous to\nthat of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), another type of intracel-\nlular Ca2(cid:1) release channel, suggesting that these two channels\nmight share a common structure for the conduction of Ca2(cid:1)\nions.",

A specific feature of NMDA\nreceptors is their voltage-dependent sensitivity to extracel-\nlular Mg2+ blockade (6). As displayed in Fig. SA, at a holding\npotential of -80 mV, perfusion of oocytes with 100 IAM\nL-glutamate evokes an inward current. Application of 100 ,uM\nMgCl2 (Mg2+-pulse ON) attenuates the L-glutamate-elicited\nresponse and prevents further current generation as long as\nit remains in the external bathing medium. L-Glutamate-\nactivated currents are restored as the magnesium is washed\nout (Mg2+-pulse OFF). In contrast, when the oocyte is held at\n-40 mV the blocking effect exerted by extracellular Mg2+ is\nless effective (Fig. SB).\n\nTo rigorously assess the voltage dependence of hNR1\nreceptor channel blockade by Mg2+, the I-V relationship was\nstudied (Fig. 5C) using a ramp protocol (10).

Similar\n(heteromeric) P2X subunits also formed trimers, as shown for co-expressed\nP2X1 and P2X2 subunits, which assembled ef\ufb01ciently to a P2X1C2 receptor\nthat was exported to the plasma membrane. In contrast, P2X6 subunits,\nwhich are incapable of forming functional homomeric channels in Xenopus\noocytes, were retained in the ER as apparent tetramers and high molecular\nmass aggregates.

It\nis possible to speculate that these receptors can be activated by ATP\nrelease [100], possibly via Panx1 channels in a process initiated by\nincreases in extracellular glutamate [101], and in turn potentiating\nPanx1 activation. Other mechanisms stimulating P2X7 receptors can\nlead to activation of Panx1 by intracellular mechanisms, namely by\nCa2 + [35,102,103] (see Fig. 1, #5). Other modes of activation of in-\ndirect activation of Panx1 channels use mitogen-activated protein ki-\nnases (MAPK) [12], Ca2 +-calmodulin kinase II [104], as well as neu-\nrotransmitters such as acetylcholine [105], and GABA [106]. Although\na physical Panx1 and P2X7 interaction complex have yet to be resolved,\nthe \ufb01rst evidence for a functional association was reported in 2006 by\nPelegrin and Surprenant using pharmacology and siRNA-mediated\nknockdown [35]. In this study, an ATP-stimulated \u201clarge pore forma-\ntion\u201d and IL-1 beta release from macrophages was shown. One model\nexplains the observed large-pore conductance as an intrinsic property of\nthe ionotropic receptors, which allow pore dilation with continued\nstimulation [107]. However, another study suggests that there may be a\nSrc kinase-dependent coupling between P2X7 and Panx1 based upon\nP2X7-mediated Panx1 activation being sensitive to Src Kinase inhibitors\nand a peptide that contains a Src homology 3 domain of P2X7 [84] (see\nFig. 1, #5). Also, genetic analysis implies that the carboxy-terminal\nregion of P2X7 could be e\ufb03cient for coupling to Panx1 [108]. A lot of\ncontroversies reside around purinergic receptor-mediated Panx1 acti-\nvation. While the exact mechanism of Panx1 activation remains to be\nelucidated, this research supports the idea of direct coupling, suggesting\nthat the activation of both Panx1 and P2X7Rs is required for full\nfunctionalities.",

In the activation potential range from (cid:4)140 to\n(cid:4)90 mV, hHCN2 and hHCN3 have similar activation kinetics, whereas\nHCN1 is much faster, and HCN4 is much slower activated. However,\neven the relatively small difference between HCN2 and HCN3 is statis-\ntically significant at p (cid:5) 0.005. These curves clearly show that hHCN1 is\nfaster than ((cid:5)) hHCN2 (cid:5) hHCN3 (cid:5) hHCN4 at all voltages. Compari-\nson of voltage-dependent activation curves and the midpoint of activa-\ntion V1\u20442 (Fig. 4A and TABLE ONE) reveals that hHCN3 channels are\nactivated at significantly more positive potentials than both hHCN2 and\nhHCN4 (differences between HCN2 and 4 are not significant) but at\nslightly more negative potentials than hHCN1. The difference between\nHCN1 and HCN3 is significant at p (cid:5) 0.001. The reversal potential Erev\nhas been determined for all four hHCN channels using the protocol\ndisplayed in Fig. 4B.

As a striking difference to\nthe other hHCNs, however, hHCN3 channels were not modulated by\nintracellular cAMP. Direct modulation of the activation kinetics by\ncAMP is a remarkable feature of the other three HCN channels (4 \u20139).\nThe mechanism of the cAMP modulation has been partially elucidated\n(12). HCN channels possess a cyclic nucleotide binding domain, located\nin the intracellular C terminus. The C terminus inhibits activation of the\nchannel by an as yet unknown interaction with the core region. Upon\nbinding of cAMP, this inhibition is released, resulting in less energy\ndemand for channel activation, leading to faster activation and a shift of\nthe activation to more positive activation potentials (12). cAMP-de-\npendent modulation is best observed with hHCN2 and hHCN4,\nwhereas hHCN1 is modulated only moderately. It has to be pointed out\nthat the voltage-dependent activation curve of hHCN1 is already at (cid:10)20\nmV more positive potentials than that of hHCN2/4 in the absence of\ncAMP, indicating that the inhibition by the C terminus is much less in\nthe first place, and thus, release of inhibition has a less pronounced\neffect. The activation curve of hHCN3 is close to that of hHCN1 chan-\nnels, suggesting that the inhibition by the C terminus is weak. Interest-\ningly, V1\u20442 and (cid:2)\n1 values of the hHCN3 channels are almost identical with\nthose for the cAMP-modulated hHCN4 channel, supporting the notion\nthat the C terminus of hHCN3 channels has a weak control on channel\nactivation.",

OTOP1 channels, unlike HV1, are not gated by voltage (Bushman et\u00a0al., \n2015; Tu et\u00a0al., 2018) but might instead be gated by protons, like Hv1 and M2 (Cherny et\u00a0al., 1995; \nLiang et\u00a0al., 2016). However, establishing that the permeant ion gates an ion channel is not trivial. \nFor example, an increase in current magnitudes as pH is lowered could be attributed to the opening \nof  channels  or  an  increase  in  the  driving  force  for  proton  entry.  Here  we  describe  the  biophysical \nresponse properties of the three murine OTOP channels to varying extracellular pH. By focusing on \nparameters that are independent of the driving force, we show that extracellular protons gate the \nthree channels in a subtype- specific manner and that the extracellular linker between transmembrane \ndomains eleven and twelve plays a role in gating.",

Mutation of this residue to Arg, to reverse the\ncharge, completely abolished CALHM1 ion currents (Fig. 1F).\nThese results indicate that D121 contributes not only to Ca2+\nselectivity, but also to the conductance pathway for other ions.\nTogether, these results demonstrate that CALHM1 itself forms\na unique plasma membrane ion channel and suggest that the\nextracellular end of putative TM3 lines the CALHM1 ion pore.",

In the region of the bundle crossing, residues Kir3.2 N94(F63), Kir3.2\nV188(T142), Kir3.1 C179/Kir3.4 C185(L144), Kir3.1 F181(F146) and Kir3.1 I182(A147) are shown. Also depicted are the two\nglycine residues (yellow: G134 and G143 in KirBac) that are proposed to form hinges at which the M2 helices could bend. \nb | Schematic showing how the bundle crossing could widen during gating. The left panel shows the arrangement of the M2\nhelices in the closed KirBac structure as seen from the cytoplasm. The right panel depicts a possible open state of the bundle\ncrossing that is generated by tilting the M2 helices of KirBac. However, the movements of the M2 helices during channel opening\ncould also include rotation and/or bending. The phenylalanine (F146), which points into the conduction pathway at the bundle\ncrossing, is shown in van-der-Waals representation. c | Comparison of the KirBac4 and KcsA5 structures, indicating that gating at\nthe selectivity filter involves movements of the pore helices. A view into the KirBac pore (left) from the extracellular side shows\nthat the pore helices are misaligned. The same view in KcsA (right) shows that all four pore helices point towards the centre of\nthe channel cavity. d | Single channel traces showing the dual-component gating that is observed in several Kir channels.\nRecordings were obtained by cell-attached patch-clamp of Xenopus oocytes expressing Kir3.2 V188G mutant channels (holding\npotential \u2013100 mV). Channel openings are represented as upward deflections. The lower trace shows the underlined part of the\nupper trace at an expanded timescale.

The Kvb1.1 N-terminal inac-\ntivating domain is similar in structure and function to the ones\nof Shaker channels (16). They inactivate the channel by bind-\ning to a receptor at or near the inner pore entrance (28),\nresembling a tethered ball and chain type mechanism (27).

The mutation, D1866Y, alters an evolutionarily conserved aspartate residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic\ndomain of the sodium channel (cid:2)subunit. The mutation decreased modulation of the (cid:2)subunit by (cid:1)1, which normally causes a negative\nshift in the voltage dependence of inactivation in oocytes. There was less of a shift with the mutant channel, resulting in a 10 mV difference\nbetween the wild-type and mutant channels in the presence of (cid:1)1. This shift increased the magnitude of the window current, which\nresulted in more persistent current during a voltage ramp. Computational analysis suggests that neurons expressing the mutant channels\nwill fire an action potential with a shorter onset delay in response to a threshold current injection, and that they will fire multiple action\npotentials with a shorter interspike interval at a higher input stimulus. These results suggest a causal relationship between a positive shift\nin the voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation and spontaneous seizure activity. Direct interaction between the cytoplasmic\nC-terminal domain of the wild-type (cid:2)subunit with the (cid:1)1 or (cid:1)3 subunit was first demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The SCN1A\npeptide K1846-R1886 is sufficient for (cid:1)subunit interaction.

Interestingly,\nagonist capsaicin only induced widening of the activation gate,\nwhile resiniferatoxin (RTX) and spider double-knot toxin (DkTx)\ntogether induced widening of both the activation gate and selec-\ntivity \ufb01lter37, suggesting that the hydrophobic I679 may serve as a\nprimary gate and the hydrophilic G463 as a secondary gate\ninvolved in activation by only a subset of TRPV1 agonists, e.g.,\nRTX/DkTx. All reported PKD2 structures revealed two similar\nconstrictions along the pore7\u20139. Compared to the PKD2 WT\nstructure captured in a closed state, the constitutively active F604P\nmutant showed no signi\ufb01cant change in the selectivity \ufb01lter\n(Supplementary Figure 8b), suggesting that the selectivity \ufb01lter does\nnot act as a gate in F604P mutation-induced activation.

Our\nmmTRPML2 structure in the apo state, obtained in lipid\nnanodiscs, which mimic the native cellular environment, will\ncontribute to a deeper understanding of channel gating\nmechanisms and corresponding biological mutational effects.\nIt is known that TRPMLs can be activated by ML-SA1 and\nendogenous PI(3,5)P2, while can be inhibited by PI(4,5)P2 and\nsphingomyelins (40\u201342).

Firstly,\nthe ELD under variable pH conditions at endosomes or lyso-\nsomes in vivo could affect TRPML2 conformation. The ELD\nforms a fenestrated canopy at the top of the channel gating and\nassembles into a highly negative electrostatic trap to facilitate\nattracting and directing of cations into the luminal pore, thus\nacting as an ion selection or guidance system.

                    "text": "The gating of an ion channel may involve complex con-\nformational changes that ultimately lead to movements of the\ngate and pore opening. To date, at least three generic modes of\ngating motion have been proposed47. The \ufb01rst one consists of a\nrigid-body iris-like rotation of the pore-lining helices around the\npore axis (e.g., in MscS channel48). In the second mode, a hinge in\nthe middle of pore-lining helices allows the distal helices to kink\nat the hinge to open the gate upon activation. A conserved glycine\nchannels has been identi\ufb01ed to act as such a\nresidue in many K\nhinge49. The third mode involves a hinge together with additional\nretraction of an aromatic gate residue which is found in several\nincluding KirBac1.1 and KirBac3.150,51. In this\nK\nstudy, we revealed a gating motion in PKD2 that involves the\ntransition of a \u03c0-helix to \u03b1-helix in the middle of the pore-lining\nS6, resulting in a combined twisting and bending motion of the\ndistal S6, which led to twisting and splaying of gate residue L677\nand pore opening (Fig. 6e). Such a transition was initially pro-\nposed as a gating mechanism in TRPV241. It should be kept in\nmind that a truncated PKD2 mutant E53-D792 was used in our\nstructural studies while the full-length PKD2 was used in the\nfunctional assays. The structure of this PKD2 truncated mutant\nmight be different from that of full-length PKD2, which may lead\nto misinterpretation of our functional data in the structural\ncontext. This \u03c0-helix structure is present in several other TRP\nchannels,\nincluding TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPML1, TRPML3,\nNOMPC, TRPM4, and TRPV6, but not in TRPV2 or TRPM8\nthe \u03c0-helix may\n(Supplementary Figure 10), suggesting that\nrepresent a shared gating element for many TRP channels, similar\nchannels49.\nto the gating hinge (conserved glycine residue) in K\nInterestingly, the most recently published TRPV6 structures in\nclosed and open states revealed an \u03b1-helix to \u03c0-helix transition\nduring TRPV6 activation52, which is opposite to the \u03c0-helix to\n\u03b1-helix transition associated with PKD2 activation. Of note, the\n\u03c0-helix could function differently in the gating of individual TRP\nmembers. In TRPV1, the \u03c0-helix more likely acts as a hinge to\nallow bending of the distal S6 upon activation induced by agonist\nchannels\ncapsaicin (Fig. 6e), analogous to the glycine hinge in K\nmentioned above. In TRPML1 and TRPML3, the \u03c0-helix does not\nseem to play a critical role in agonist ML-SA1-induced channel\nactivation, which is accomplished by displacement of the entire\nS6 helix (Fig. 6e). The diverse roles of \u03c0-helices possibly re\ufb02ect the\nfact that TRP channels are polymodal receptors responding to\nmultiple stimuli. Future efforts are needed to resolve more open-\nstate structures in the presence of different stimuli to elucidate the\ndynamic functions of the \u03c0-helix in the gating of TRP channels.\nTo date, several studies have reported that cytoplasmic Ca2+\ncan act as an agonist of PKD2 at low concentrations6,20,53\u201355.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins).

Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore. Large,\nimpermeant\nanions would prevent the passage of both anions\nand cations (regardless of the latter\u2019s size), whereas\nlarge, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-\nvent all ion permeation, but would make the channel\nmore anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

Here, we found that NALCN, when co-expressed with \nUNC79, UNC80, and FAM155, exhibits an unusual modulation by \nmembrane voltage (Fig.\u00a01). This highlights how voltage sensor do-\nmains can, depending on the context, contribute to gating in previ-\nously unanticipated ways and thus contributes to our understanding \nof how this widely encountered motif can modulate ion channel func-\ntion (37). We show that the voltage dependence originates from posi-\ntively charged residues in the S4 segments of DI and DII of NALCN, as \ncharge-neutralizing substitutions affected voltage sensitivity (Fig.\u00a04). \nNALCN had been suggested to be a nonselective cation channel that \npoorly discriminates between X+ and X2+. This lack of ion selectivity is \noften attributed to the EEKE SF motif of NALCN, which is a hybrid \nbetween the Na+-selective DEKA and the Ca2+-selective EEEE. Here, we \nfound that NALCN is moderately selective among the permeable X+, \nbut does not conduct X2+. The X+ selectivity profile is altered when the \nEEKE motif was mutated to DEKA (Fig.\u00a02C). Furthermore, some charge- \nneutralizing mutations around the putative channel pore also affected \ncurrent rectification and phenotype (Fig.\u00a03D and fig. S5B). For instance, \nthe K1115A mutant displays a unique \u201chooked\u201d phenotype (Fig.\u00a03D), \nconsistent with the notion that this side chain lines the ion permeation \npathway.

Store-dependent activation can be demonstrated both in patch-clamp experiments when cells are perfused with InsP3 (Fig. 3A) or when store depletion is caused by ionomycin (Fig. 3C), which both result in rapid activation of CRAC currents.

We therefore examined whether STIM2 can\nserve as a Ca2+ sensor and activate CRAC channels in a store-dependent manner when\nSTIM1 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNA (siRNA). We confirmed the\nefficacy of siRNA treatment in wild-type (wt) HEK293 cells, where endogenous CRAC\ncurrents were almost completely suppressed after siRNA treatment (Fig. 3E). However, in\nparallel experiments performed in STIM2- and CRACM1-expressing cells, STIM1\nknockdown did not significantly affect the bi-phasic CRAC currents (Fig. 3F), suggesting\nthat STIM2 has the intrinsic ability to respond to store depletion. We surmised that the Ca2+-\nsensing function of STIM2 might be mediated by an EF-hand motif located in the N\nterminus of the protein facing the lumen of the ER, since such a motif is also found in\nSTIM1 and has been shown to serve this function (8, 17, 27). To test this idea, we\nintroduced a point mutation into the EF-hand motif of the STIM2 protein (D80A) that would\nbe predicted to disrupt Ca2+ binding. The equivalent mutation in STIM1 (D76A) has been\nshown to abolish its Ca2+-sensing function and results in constitutive activation of SOCE (8,\n17, 27). As illustrated in Fig. 3F, the D80A mutant of STIM2 failed to support the rapid,\nstore-operated activation phase of CRAC channels, whereas the delayed, store-independent\nactivation phase remained unaffected. Together, these results suggest that STIM2 can\nmediate both store-operated and store-independent activation of CRAC channels\nindependent of STIM1 and that the Ca2+-sensing function of STIM2 resides within its\nluminal EF-hand motif.",

Although STIM1 acts as a\nluminal Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the function of STIM2 remains unclear.\nHere we reveal that STIM2 has two distinct modes of activating CRAC channels: a store-operated\nmode that is activated through depletion of ER Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)\nand store-independent activation that is mediated by cell dialysis during whole-cell perfusion.\nBoth modes are regulated by calmodulin (CaM). The store-operated mode is transient in intact\ncells, possibly reflecting recruitment of CaM, whereas loss of CaM in perfused cells accounts for\nthe persistence of the store-independent mode. The inhibition by CaM can be reversed by 2-\naminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), resulting in rapid, store-independent activation of CRAC\nchannels. The aminoglycoside antibiotic G418 is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of STIM2-\ndependent CRAC channel activation. The results reveal a novel bimodal control of CRAC\nchannels by STIM2, the store dependence and CaM regulation, which indicates that the STIM2/\nCRACM1 complex may be under the control of both luminal and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels.",

Recent findings have implicated two proteins,\nStim1 and Orai1, as having essential roles in store-operated Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane.\nHowever, transient overexpression of these proteins on their own results in little or no increase in\nstore operated entry. Here we demonstrate dramatic synergism between these two mediators; co-\ntransfection of HEK293 cells with Stim1 and Orai1 results in an approximate 20-fold increase in\nstore-operated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-selective current. This demonstrates that these two proteins are\nlimiting for both the signaling and permeation mechanisms for Ca2+-selective store-operated Ca2+\nentry. There are three mammalian homologs of Orai1, and in expression experiments they all\nproduced or augmented store-operated Ca2+ entry with efficacies in the order Orai1 > Orai2 > Orai3.\nStim1 apparently initiates the signaling process by acting as a Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic\nreticulum. This results in rearrangement of Stim1 within the cell and migration toward the plasma\nmembrane to regulate in some manner Orai1 located in the plasma membrane. However, we\ndemonstrate that Stim1 does not incorporate in the surface membrane, and thus likely regulates or\ninteracts with Orai1 at sites of close apposition between the plasma membrane and an intracellular\nStim1-containing organelle.",

In addition, pathological phenotypes have been reported in\nknockout mice de\ufb01cient in expression of other SLC26 isoforms for which human mutations\nhave not yet been associated with diseases (Table 1) (8\u201311). As the member which has the most\n\u2212\nextensive transport functions in the family, SLC26A6 can mediate the transport of Cl\u2212/HCO\n3 as\nwell as other anions which include Cl\u2212/formate, Cl\u2212/oxalate, Cl\u2212/nitrate, SO2\u2212\n4 /oxalate and\nCl\u2212/OH\u2212 (12, 13). However, in non-epithelial tissues, SLC26A6 functions predominantly as\nCl\u2212/HCO\n3 and OH\u2212 exchangers (14). SLC26A6 is strongly expressed in the intercalated ducts of\npancreas (15, 16), proximal tubules of kidney, and proximal small intestine (17, 18). The expression\nhas also been found in the heart (19), reproductive system (20), placenta (21), parotid gland\n(22), esophagus (23), stomach (24), and even teeth (25, 26) of mammals. Systematic study on the\ndistribution of SLC26A6 in human tissues is lacking, and it may be di\ufb03cult to detect by Western",

By analogy, the neuron-specific MICU37,39 might also indirectly \nmodulate uniporter activation through concerted conformational changes with MICU1. \nFinally, our structures and a previous MCU-EMRE subcomplex structure27 show that the \nuniporter can dimerize. Such dimerization is not required for basic channel function but may \ncontribute to biased uniporter distribution toward inner/outer membrane contact sites, where \nnearby crista junctions could potentially provide favorable curvature to accommodate the V-\nshaped dimer. Such spatial arrangement could presumably maximize the uniporter\u2019s \nexposure to intracellular Ca2+ signals, thus facilitating effective Ca2+ transmission from the \nendoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondrial matrix40.",

Thus, while ion selectivity of verte-\nbrate and invertebrate OTOP channels has been \nwell  established  (Tu  et\u00a0 al.,  2018;  Chen  et\u00a0 al., \n2019),  descriptions  of  basic  gating  mecha-\nnisms  have  been  limited.  For  example,  previous \nstudies showed that the channels are not voltage- \nsensitive  (Tu  et\u00a0 al.,  2018),  but  whether  they  are \nligand- gated was not known. Here we provide the \nfirst direct evidence that the three murine OTOP \nchannels  are  gated  by  extracellular  protons  in  a \nsubtype- specific  manner  (Figure\u00a0 9).  OTOP1  and \nOTOP3  show  no  or  little  activity  at  neutral  pHo \nand are activated by lowering pH, while OTOP2 \nis active at neutral and alkaline pHo, and lowering \npHo  appears  to  inhibit  the  channel.  The  varying \npH sensitivity of the three vertebrate OTOP channels may allow them to subserve different functions \nin the cells within which they are expressed and is reminiscent of the varying temperatures sensitivities \nof thermo- TRP channels (Dhaka et\u00a0al., 2006).",
