Here we have sought
to characterize the functional properties of
channels composed of the human Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 subunits in the
absence and presence of auxiliary subunits such as human Kvb1.1 and
Kvb1.2. We have demonstrated that the hetero-oligomeric assemblies
of these subunits generate channels with distinct gating properties that
are profoundly modiﬁed by several mutations identiﬁed in the KCNA1
gene of EA1-affected patients.

Neurophysiological and disease implications

Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvb1.x subunits form the A-type potassium
channel. These channel types control the ﬁring properties of neurones
and their response to input stimuli (Connor & Stevens, 1971). The
functional properties of Kv1.4-1.1 ⁄ Kvb1.1 showed some similarities
with the potassium currents characterized by Geiger & Jonas (2000) in
hippocampal mossy ﬁbre boutons. However, some biophysical
parameters such as the inactivation V1 ⁄ 2 and refractory period are

pubmed: 20393197, text: Coexpression of KCNE1 or KCNE3 with the Kv7.1
channel elicits dramatic and opposing effects on Kv7.1
channel gating behavior. Association of KCNE1 with
Kv7.1 apparently stabilizes a closed conformation of the
Kv7.1 channel, whereas the one of KCNE3 with Kv7.1
seems to destabilize the closed (or conversely stabilize
the opened) Kv7.1 channel. Main features of KCNE1 ef-
fects on Kv7.1 channel gating are a marked slowing of the
activation time course, a voltage-conductance relation
shifted by (cid:2)20 mV to more positive potentials, suppres-
sion of inactivation, and four- to sevenfold increase in
single-channel conductance (23, 223, 248, 268, 279, 340).
Potential effects of KCNE1 on Ca2(cid:1)-dependent gating of
the Kv7.1 channel are still unexplored. In contrast, asso-
ciation of KCNE3 with Kv7.1 generates voltage-indepen-
dent channels (Fig. 13D). The complete loss in voltage-
dependent gating is accompanied by an (cid:2)10-fold increase
in current density (3, 27, 257). Gating properties of the
KCNE3/Kv7.1 channel resemble those of a K(cid:1) channel
found in crypt cells of small intestine and colon. This K(cid:1)
channel is open at the membrane resting potential and
plays an important role in K(cid:1) recycling by crypt cells. In
summary, heterologous expression of KCNEs with Kv7.1
can generate both voltage-dependent and voltage-inde-
pendent K(cid:1) channels that resemble important K(cid:1) chan-
nels in native tissue (Fig. 13).

of lipid raft microdomains. Electrophysiological studies supported that KCNE1 and KCNE3 regulatory subunits further

pubmed: 17453412, text: CLIC4 is poorly-selective between anions and
cations,
inconsistent with the widely-adopted
‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature proposed by [18] and [40].
It may be necessary to re-evaluate CLIC proteins,
especially CLIC4, as ‘‘chloride’’ channels, if they
behave like non-selective channels. This could be
due to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.
However, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in
KCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as
found for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini
and Nonner
[41,42] noted similar paradoxical
behaviour in neuronal ‘‘background’’ Cl(cid:4) channels,
and suggested that anions and cations crossed the
membrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on
similar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4
contains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as
suggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-
meant anions could provide an opportunity for
counter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane
without encountering a prohibitive positive charge.
In a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the
presence of anions, and they must be sufficiently
small to penetrate the pore. Large,
impermeant
anions would prevent the passage of both anions
and cations (regardless of the latter’s size), whereas
large, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-
vent all ion permeation, but would make the channel
more anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we
noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the
presence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-
pared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable
to discriminate between a range of different anions,
again consistent with the idea that the pore itself is
poorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but
measurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],

Oxidation of soluble CLIC1 induces a completely
new protein conformation involving intrachain dis-
ulphide bond formation and non-covalent associa-
tion into dimers [34], but a similar mechanism has
been ruled out for CLIC4 [12], so we speculate that
following membrane insertion the pore-lining re-
gions of CLIC4 remain the same irrespective of
oxidation or reduction. Instead, we suggest that the
difference in selectivity observed here could be due to
changes in the charged surface of the protein, away
from the putative TMD, that affect the channel
vestibule(s) or entrance(s). This suggestion is con-
sistent with experiments involving truncated CLIC4.

pubmed: 29845874, text: components (720). While Fahlke and colleagues concluded
that intrinsic sensors of the protein are underlying its volt-
age dependence (232, 233), there is ample evidence that the
basic mechanisms of voltage-dependent gating of ClC-1 are
similar to those of ClC-0, and that gating is strongly cou-
pled to anion/proton movements within the pore (8, 479,
719 –721). In particular, reduction of the extracellular Cl(cid:2)
concentration leads to a shift of the voltage dependence of
the open probability to more positive voltages (720), similar
to its effect on ClC-0 fast gating. Compared with ClC-0,
gating of ClC-1 is relatively insensitive to the intracellular
Cl(cid:2) concentration (720). Interestingly, the myotonia caus-
ing mutation A331T, located in the extracellular loop con-
necting helices I and J, induces a [Cl(cid:2)]i sensitivity of gating
(886). Similar to the fast gate of ClC-0, gating of ClC-1 is
dependent on pHi, with faster deactivation at more alkaline
pH (479, 720).

pubmed: 17453412, text: CLIC4 is poorly-selective between anions and
cations,
inconsistent with the widely-adopted
‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature proposed by [18] and [40].
It may be necessary to re-evaluate CLIC proteins,
especially CLIC4, as ‘‘chloride’’ channels, if they
behave like non-selective channels. This could be
due to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.
However, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in
KCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as
found for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini
and Nonner
[41,42] noted similar paradoxical
behaviour in neuronal ‘‘background’’ Cl(cid:4) channels,
and suggested that anions and cations crossed the
membrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on
similar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4
contains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as
suggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-
meant anions could provide an opportunity for
counter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane
without encountering a prohibitive positive charge.
In a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the
presence of anions, and they must be sufficiently
small to penetrate the pore. Large,
impermeant
anions would prevent the passage of both anions
and cations (regardless of the latter’s size), whereas
large, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-
vent all ion permeation, but would make the channel
more anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we
noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the
presence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-
pared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable
to discriminate between a range of different anions,
again consistent with the idea that the pore itself is
poorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but
measurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],
so if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for
this difference (and the sequences are very similar, as
shown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that

pubmed: 20393197, text: Coexpression of KCNE1 or KCNE3 with the Kv7.1
channel elicits dramatic and opposing effects on Kv7.1
channel gating behavior. Association of KCNE1 with
Kv7.1 apparently stabilizes a closed conformation of the
Kv7.1 channel, whereas the one of KCNE3 with Kv7.1
seems to destabilize the closed (or conversely stabilize
the opened) Kv7.1 channel. Main features of KCNE1 ef-
fects on Kv7.1 channel gating are a marked slowing of the
activation time course, a voltage-conductance relation
shifted by (cid:2)20 mV to more positive potentials, suppres-
sion of inactivation, and four- to sevenfold increase in
single-channel conductance (23, 223, 248, 268, 279, 340).
Potential effects of KCNE1 on Ca2(cid:1)-dependent gating of
the Kv7.1 channel are still unexplored. In contrast, asso-
ciation of KCNE3 with Kv7.1 generates voltage-indepen-
dent channels (Fig. 13D). The complete loss in voltage-
dependent gating is accompanied by an (cid:2)10-fold increase
in current density (3, 27, 257). Gating properties of the
KCNE3/Kv7.1 channel resemble those of a K(cid:1) channel
found in crypt cells of small intestine and colon. This K(cid:1)
channel is open at the membrane resting potential and
plays an important role in K(cid:1) recycling by crypt cells. In
summary, heterologous expression of KCNEs with Kv7.1
can generate both voltage-dependent and voltage-inde-
pendent K(cid:1) channels that resemble important K(cid:1) chan-
nels in native tissue (Fig. 13).

channel elicits dramatic and opposing effects on Kv7.1
channel gating behavior. Association of KCNE1 with
Kv7.1 apparently stabilizes a closed conformation of the
Kv7.1 channel, whereas the one of KCNE3 with Kv7.1
seems to destabilize the closed (or conversely stabilize
the opened) Kv7.1 channel. Main features of KCNE1 ef-
fects on Kv7.1 channel gating are a marked slowing of the
activation time course, a voltage-conductance relation
shifted by (cid:2)20 mV to more positive potentials, suppres-
sion of inactivation, and four- to sevenfold increase in
single-channel conductance (23, 223, 248, 268, 279, 340).
Potential effects of KCNE1 on Ca2(cid:1)-dependent gating of
the Kv7.1 channel are still unexplored. In contrast, asso-
ciation of KCNE3 with Kv7.1 generates voltage-indepen-
dent channels (Fig. 13D). The complete loss in voltage-
dependent gating is accompanied by an (cid:2)10-fold increase
in current density (3, 27, 257). Gating properties of the
KCNE3/Kv7.1 channel resemble those of a K(cid:1) channel
found in crypt cells of small intestine and colon. This K(cid:1)
channel is open at the membrane resting potential and
plays an important role in K(cid:1) recycling by crypt cells. In
summary, heterologous expression of KCNEs with Kv7.1
can generate both voltage-dependent and voltage-inde-
pendent K(cid:1) channels that resemble important K(cid:1) chan-
nels in native tissue (Fig. 13).

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) and its close

their high selectivity for calcium over monovalent cations (PCa/
PNa >100:1) (1). They are also distinct from other members of
the vanilloid subfamily (TRPV1–4) in that they are not known to
be thermosensitive or ligand-activated (2, 3). Physiologically, TRPV5
and TRPV6 serve as apical entryways into epithelial cells that line
segments of the intestine and kidney, initiating transcellular cal-
cium transport that helps fine-tune serum calcium levels (4).
Disturbances in the body’s calcium balance can cause major health
including neurologic and cardiac aberrations, stone

TRPV5 are associated with altered renal calcium handling and
increased risk of recurrent kidney stones (8–10).

proteins responsible for reabsorption of Ca2(cid:1) in the kidney

protein from Caenorhabditis elegans (for a detailed review, see
Refs. 4, 27). Functionally, the six mammalian members of the
TRPV subfamily can be subdivided in two groups: TRPV1 to
TRPV4 are Ca2(cid:1)-permeable, nonselective cation channels with

TRPP2 and VGICs Share a Voltage-Dependent Gating Mechanism. A
cardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents
activated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion
flow during the transition from the open to closed states in the
whole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly
found in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have
previously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29–31). In the
symmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-
cell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-
ate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a
Boltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal
voltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =
47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is
shallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately
1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Based on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that
TRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-
ment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and
TRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25–
28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)
structurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions

pubmed: 31315976, text: Discussion
VGICs and TRPP2 Channel Opening Requires Activation of the VSD.
VGICs open their ion conducting pores in response to changes in
membrane potential. This conformational change is preceded by
movement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage
sensors—a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical
impulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low
open probability with voltage stimulation alone and require
specific ligand interactions or other stimuli
to fully open.
Structural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML
channels suggest
their VSD-like domains form ligand
binding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation
(41–45). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical
mechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic
mediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in
general, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-
ered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that
TRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-
lated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial
gating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD
appears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel
opening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our
Rosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in
conjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-
cystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in
VGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural
features of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix
models (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-
rangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 Å across
the membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise
counter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar
and electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same
time, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-
tracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-
dues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is
activated (48).

pubmed: 31315976, text: 37 mV more negative than channel opening. The TRPP2 gating
current is one-fourth the size of those measured from voltage-
gated Nav, Cav, and Kv channels. This is expected since TRPP2
has fewer gating charges than are found within typical VGIC
voltage sensors (2 vs. 4 to 6 charges per voltage sensor). We
demonstrate that preservation of both K3 and K4 gating charge
positions is essential for the function of both TRPP2 and a
typical VGIC, NaChBac. These results are supported by muta-
genesis studies in the Shaker Kv channel, where the number of
gating charges could not be reduced beyond positions K3 and K4
(49). With few exceptions, TRP channels do not have gating
charges within their VSD. The cold-sensitive TRPM8 channel
has a single positively charged residue at gating charge position
K4 (44). While there is significant functional evidence that
TRPM8 currents are voltage dependent, there are no reports of
gating currents measured from TRPM8 channels. In addition,
neutralizing the putative gating charge alters voltage and thermal
sensitivity but does not abolish the ionic conductance entirely
(50). Thus, it appears that TRPM8 can still function without a
gating charge, an indication that its activation mechanism is
different from that of TRPP2 and VGICs. In this study, we have
shown that TRPP2 channels can be potentiated by osmotic
membrane swelling and heat. However, these stimuli potentiate
the TRPP2 current using distinct mechanisms. We find that
membrane swelling reduces the membrane potential required to
move the gating charge and enhances its open probability at
negative membrane potentials. This is achieved by increasing the
voltage sensitivity of the gating charges in the VSD. In contrast,
heat enhances TRPP2 unitary ion conductance, a parameter
controlled by the PD. Future work will be directed at a structural
mechanism showing how the VSD activation integrates the
membrane tension to alter TRPP2’s voltage-dependent activa-
tion. Importantly, all polymodal means of activating TRPP2 fail
to open the channel when 1 of the gating charges is neutralized.

pubmed: 29742403, text: ABSTRACT The CaV1.2 L-type calcium channel is a key conduit for Ca2þ
inﬂux to initiate excitation-contraction coupling for
contraction of the heart and vasoconstriction of the arteries and for altering membrane excitability in neurons. Its a1C pore-form-
ing subunit is known to undergo extensive alternative splicing to produce many CaV1.2 isoforms that differ in their electrophys-
iological and pharmacological properties. Here, we examined the structure-function relationship of human CaV1.2 with respect to
the inclusion or exclusion of mutually exclusive exons of the N-terminus exons 1/1a and IS6 segment exons 8/8a. These exons
showed tissue selectivity in their expression patterns: heart variant 1a/8a, one smooth-muscle variant 1/8, and a brain isoform
1/8a. Overall, the 1/8a, when coexpressed with CaVb2a, displayed a signiﬁcant and distinct shift in voltage-dependent activation
and inactivation and inactivation kinetics as compared to the other three splice variants. Further analysis showed a clear additive
effect of the hyperpolarization shift in V1/2inact of CaV1.2 channels containing exon 1 in combination with 8a. However, this ad-
ditive effect was less distinct for V1/2act. However, the measured effects were b-subunit-dependent when comparing CaVb2a with
CaVb3 coexpression. Notably, calcium-dependent inactivation mediated by local Ca2þ
-sensing via the N-lobe of calmodulin was
signiﬁcantly enhanced in exon-1-containing CaV1.2 as compared to exon-1a-containing CaV1.2 channels. At the cellular level,
the current densities of the 1/8a or 1/8 variants were signiﬁcantly larger than the 1a/8a and 1a/8 variants when coexpressed
either with CaVb2a or CaVb3 subunit. This ﬁnding correlated well with a higher channel surface expression for the exon
1-CaV1.2 isoform that we quantiﬁed by protein surface-expression levels or by gating currents. Our data also provided a deeper
molecular understanding of the altered biophysical properties of alternatively spliced human CaV1.2 channels by directly
comparing unitary single-channel events with macroscopic whole-cell currents.

pubmed: 20393197, text: Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels selectively
catalyze the transport of K(cid:1) across the plasma membrane.
The channels are multisubunit complexes, being com-
posed of membrane-integrated Kv(cid:2)-subunits and of ac-
cessory subunits. Kv(cid:2)-subunits form a tetrameric protein
complex that assembles the core of a Kv channel consist-
ing of a pore domain with activation (and inactivation)
gate(s) and selectivity ﬁlter linked to peripheral voltage-
sensor domains. In in vitro expression systems, most
Kv(cid:2)-subunits form functional Kv channels, reproducing
basic Kv channel properties such as opening and closing
(gating) of the pore in response to a change in the mem-
brane electric ﬁeld (60, 219, 283, 342). The activation
process is well described by a sequential gating model, in
which voltage-sensor movements in each Kv(cid:2)-subunit are
usually followed by a concerted pore opening step to
permit passage of K(cid:1). The details of conformational
changes associated with the electromechanical coupling-
mechanism between voltage sensor and activation gate
are presently under intense investigation (33, 153, 154,
282).
