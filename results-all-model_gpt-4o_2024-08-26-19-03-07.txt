All K+ channels can discriminate between K+ and Na+,
the most abundant alkali metal ions in nature. Without
such ion selectivity, channels would not be able to 
generate electrical signals. Selectivity for K+ is conferred
by the selectivity filter, defined as the narrowest part of
the conduction pathway in the open channel (FIG. 1c).
In all K+ channel crystal structures solved so far, the main-
chain carbonyl oxygens of the conserved K+ channel 
signature  sequence  (TXGYG  or  TXGFG), which  is
located in the P-loop, form the selectivity filter (FIG. 3).
Point mutations in the K+ channel signature sequence
abolish K+ selectivity16. At the phenotypic level, this loss
of K+ selectivity is linked to the movement disorder that
is observed in weaver mice17–20.

Kv channels and the only one expressed on human T cells1,4,17,18.
The Kv1 channels are tetramers and each subunit has a large
cytoplasmic domain called T1, and six transmembrane helices
called S1-S6, with S1-S4 forming a voltage-sensing domain (VSD)
and S5-S6 forming the ion conducting pore domain19–23. The S5-
S6 region harbors the P-loop, which in turn contains the highly
conserved selectivity ﬁlter responsible for coordinating K+ ions
and maintaining K+ permeation24. The selectivity ﬁlter contains
the TXGYG motif which is highly conserved in potassium
channels and is known as the potassium channel signature
sequence25. The ﬁlter is structured with the backbone carbonyls
of the signature sequence directed into the pore along the four-
fold symmetry axis of the channel26. The structure formed by the
carbonyls is evolved to precisely coordinate dehydrated K+ ions
and select for potassium over sodium27. Structures of potassium
channels most commonly show the selectivity ﬁlter coordinating
up to four K+ ions with additional K+ ions in the cavity below
the ﬁlter, or situated above the ﬁlter19,21,24,26. The four S6 helices
in a tetramer come together on the intracellular side of the
membrane to form the internal gate. The gate is closed when the
cell
is at rest but upon membrane depolarization the VSDs
undergo a conformational change that opens the gate and allows
K+ ion efﬂux28–30.

Here we have sought
to characterize the functional properties of
channels composed of the human Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 subunits in the
absence and presence of auxiliary subunits such as human Kvb1.1 and
Kvb1.2. We have demonstrated that the hetero-oligomeric assemblies
of these subunits generate channels with distinct gating properties that
are profoundly modiﬁed by several mutations identiﬁed in the KCNA1
gene of EA1-affected patients.

Neurophysiological and disease implications

Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvb1.x subunits form the A-type potassium
channel. These channel types control the ﬁring properties of neurones
and their response to input stimuli (Connor & Stevens, 1971). The
functional properties of Kv1.4-1.1 ⁄ Kvb1.1 showed some similarities
with the potassium currents characterized by Geiger & Jonas (2000) in
hippocampal mossy ﬁbre boutons. However, some biophysical
parameters such as the inactivation V1 ⁄ 2 and refractory period are

The channels are multisubunit complexes, being com-

cessory subunits. Kv(cid:2)-subunits form a tetrameric protein
complex that assembles the core of a Kv channel consist-

basic Kv channel properties such as opening and closing

brane electric ﬁeld (60, 219, 283, 342). The activation
process is well described by a sequential gating model, in
which voltage-sensor movements in each Kv(cid:2)-subunit are
usually followed by a concerted pore opening step to
permit passage of K(cid:1). The details of conformational
changes associated with the electromechanical coupling-
mechanism between voltage sensor and activation gate

it is assumed that the mechanism of ion selectivity

pubmed: 18794847, text: To investigate the ionic selectivity of GPHR, the relative anion per-
meabilities (Px/PCl, where x is an anion) were measured (Fig. 6d). The 
halide anion permeability sequence was I– (1.5) > Cl– (1.0) = Br– (1.0) 
> F– (0.9) relative to Cl–. Methanesulfonate was impermeant (data not 
shown). Consistent with the nature of an anion channel, the channel 
was  inhibited  by  4,4´-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2´-disulfonic  acid 
(DIDS; Fig. 6e). After adding DIDS, the current amplitude began to 
flicker, shifted to subconductance states and eventually became almost 
completely blocked (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S7a). The slow 
response was most probably due to our inability to stir the solution vig-
orously. To verify that this anion channel behaviour was derived from 
GPHR protein and not from contaminating proteins, preimmune or 
anti-GPHR rabbit serum was added to the lipid bilayer system (Fig. 6f). 
There was no significant change in the current amplitude following the 
addition of preimmune serum, whereas the channel current amplitude 
began to flicker just after the addition of a 1:50 volume of anti-GPHR 
serum to the upper compartment. Although the single-channel current 
was not completely inhibited to the basal level, it rapidly made the transi-
tion to multiple subconductance states (Fig. 6f and see Supplementary 
Information, Fig. S7b, c), indicating that the anion channel behaviour 
did indeed arise from the function of GPHR.

ons versus K+ cations (PCl/PK = 2.8) than GOLAC-2 (PCl/PK = 6.1) and 
some of the values described above differ somewhat from those of the 
GPHR channel, these differences may arise from the effects of the extra 
tags on GPHR because GOLAC-2 was examined as an endogenous 
protein without manipulation, in addition to differences between the 
protein species, preparation methods and composition of buffer and

is identical to GOLAC-2.

TRPP2 and VGICs Share a Voltage-Dependent Gating Mechanism. A
cardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents
activated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion
flow during the transition from the open to closed states in the
whole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly
found in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have
previously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29–31). In the
symmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-
cell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-
ate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a
Boltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal
voltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =
47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is
shallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately
1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Based on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that
TRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-
ment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and
TRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25–
28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)
structurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions

CLICs exist as soluble and membranous proteins [3],
and they interact with various other cytosolic proteins
[15]. As CLIC function was investigated by their
reconstitution in planar bilayers,
it is possible that
modulation of either channel permeability or selectivity
by cytoplasmic and membranous components present
inside an intact cell may have been overlooked. How-
ever, as the channel properties of CLIC5 have not
been reported to date, this reduced system has the
advantage of characterizing CLIC5 function in the
absence of modulatory factors. Furthermore, the role
of actin in regulating channel function is best observed
in such a reduced system considering the multiple and

pubmed: 17453412, text: CLIC4 is poorly-selective between anions and
cations,
inconsistent with the widely-adopted
‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature proposed by [18] and [40].
It may be necessary to re-evaluate CLIC proteins,
especially CLIC4, as ‘‘chloride’’ channels, if they
behave like non-selective channels. This could be
due to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.
However, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in
KCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as
found for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini
and Nonner
[41,42] noted similar paradoxical
behaviour in neuronal ‘‘background’’ Cl(cid:4) channels,
and suggested that anions and cations crossed the
membrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on
similar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4
contains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as
suggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-
meant anions could provide an opportunity for
counter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane
without encountering a prohibitive positive charge.
In a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the
presence of anions, and they must be sufficiently
small to penetrate the pore. Large,
impermeant
anions would prevent the passage of both anions
and cations (regardless of the latter’s size), whereas
large, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-
vent all ion permeation, but would make the channel
more anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we
noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the
presence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-
pared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable
to discriminate between a range of different anions,
again consistent with the idea that the pore itself is
poorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but
measurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],
so if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for
this difference (and the sequences are very similar, as
shown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that

(1, 2). A new class of chloride ion channel, the “chloride intra-

Despite being synthesized in the cytosol without a leader sequence, the soluble 253-residue mammalian protein CLIC4
(Chloride Intracellular Channel 4, or p64H1), a structural homologue of V-type glutathione-S-transferase, autoinserts into
membranes to form an integral membrane protein with ion channel activity. A predicted transmembrane domain (TMD)
near the N-terminus of CLIC4 could mediate membrane insertion, and contribute to oligomeric pores, with minimal
reorganization of the soluble protein structure. We tested this idea by reconstituting recombinant CLIC4 in planar bilayers
containing phosphatidyethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, recording ion channels with a maximum
conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in KCl under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The channels discriminated poorly
between anions and cations, incompatible with the current ‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature, and their conductance was modified by
the trans (external or luminal) redox potential, as previously observed for CLIC1. We then reconstituted a truncated version
of the protein, limited to the first 61 residues containing the predicted TMD. This included a single trans cysteine residue in
the putative pore-forming subunits, at the external entrance to the pore. The truncated protein formed non-selective
channels with a reduced conductance, but they retained their trans -redox sensitivity, and could still be blocked or
inactivated by trans (not cis ) thiol-reative dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid. We suggest that oligomers containing the putative
TMD are essential components of the CLIC4 pore. However, the pore is inherently non-selective, and any ionic selectivity
in CLIC4 (and other membrane CLICs) may be attributable to other regions of the protein, including the channel
vestibules.

pubmed: 11551966, text: Formation of Chloride Ion Channels by CLIC1 in Lipid Bi-
layers—The fact that CLIC1 (and the CLICs) are cytoplasmic
as well as membrane proteins in distribution and appear to
contain the domains of a functional GSH-dependent redox pro-
tein structurally related to the GST superfamily raises the
question as to whether CLIC1 is a just a regulatory element
controlling an integral membrane ion channel. Several lines of
evidence indicate that the CLIC proteins exist in a true integral
membrane form. First, the CLIC4 fraction that partitions in
the membrane is resistant to alkali extraction (8, 18, 22).
Second, immunogold electron microscopy using an antibody
generated against an 18-amino acid peptide from the carboxyl
terminus of p62 shows that the protein is localized to the
osteoclast ruffled border membrane with 66% of the gold beads
within one bead diameter of the membrane (15). Also, our
previous studies using epitope-tagged CLIC1-transfected CHO
cells indicate that CLIC1 is a transmembrane protein that
directly forms part of the ion channel whose conductance is
blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the epitope tag. Further,
we could deduce that the amino terminus projects outward, and
the carboxyl terminus projects inward from the plasma mem-
brane (12), indicating that the protein spans the membrane an
odd number of times. Finally, a recent study (13) has shown
that recombinant CLIC1 can form chloride ion channels in lipid
bilayers, but the characteristics of the channels differed from
those measured in CHO cells transfected with CLIC1 (5, 12).
To evaluate the ability of our purified recombinant CLIC1 to
form ion channels we used the tip-dip electrophysiological tech-
nique (34, 44). Following bilayer formation on the patch pi-
pette, we added the purified recombinant CLIC1 to the bath

All K+ channels can discriminate between K+ and Na+,
the most abundant alkali metal ions in nature. Without
such ion selectivity, channels would not be able to 
generate electrical signals. Selectivity for K+ is conferred
by the selectivity filter, defined as the narrowest part of
the conduction pathway in the open channel (FIG. 1c).
In all K+ channel crystal structures solved so far, the main-
chain carbonyl oxygens of the conserved K+ channel 
signature  sequence  (TXGYG  or  TXGFG), which  is
located in the P-loop, form the selectivity filter (FIG. 3).
Point mutations in the K+ channel signature sequence
abolish K+ selectivity16. At the phenotypic level, this loss
of K+ selectivity is linked to the movement disorder that
is observed in weaver mice17–20.

is conserved between all K+ channels, and the KcsA 
pore can substitute for the pore of other K+ channels26,
it is assumed that the mechanism of ion selectivity 
and permeation at the selectivity filter is similar in all 
K+ channels.

In Kir channels, structural features other than the 
K+ channel signature sequence are also important for K+
selectivity. Differences in the residues that surround 
the selectivity filter account for the reduced K+ selectivity
of Kir3.1 compared with other Kir3 family members27.
Certain mutations in the pore helix or in M2 of Kir3.2
cause a loss of K+ selectivity28. In most Kir channels,
a  SALT  BRIDGE between  conserved  charged  residues

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) and its close
homolog TRPV6 are unique among all TRP channels because of
their high selectivity for calcium over monovalent cations (PCa/
PNa >100:1) (1). They are also distinct from other members of
the vanilloid subfamily (TRPV1–4) in that they are not known to
be thermosensitive or ligand-activated (2, 3). Physiologically, TRPV5
and TRPV6 serve as apical entryways into epithelial cells that line
segments of the intestine and kidney, initiating transcellular cal-
cium transport that helps fine-tune serum calcium levels (4).
Disturbances in the body’s calcium balance can cause major health
including neurologic and cardiac aberrations, stone
problems,

TRPV5 are associated with altered renal calcium handling and
increased risk of recurrent kidney stones (8–10).

TRPP2 and VGICs Share a Voltage-Dependent Gating Mechanism. A
cardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents
activated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion
flow during the transition from the open to closed states in the
whole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly
found in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have
previously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29–31). In the
symmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-
cell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-
ate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a
Boltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal
voltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =
47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is
shallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately
1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Based on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that
TRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-
ment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and
TRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25–
28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)
structurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions

pubmed: 31315976, text: The opening of voltage-gated ion channels is initiated by transfer
of gating charges that sense the electric field across the mem-
brane. Although transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP)
are members of this family, their opening is not intrinsically linked
to membrane potential, and they are generally not considered
voltage gated. Here we demonstrate that TRPP2, a member of the
polycystin subfamily of TRP channels encoded by the PKD2L1
gene, is an exception to this rule. TRPP2 borrows a biophysical riff
from canonical voltage-gated ion channels, using 2 gating charges
found in its fourth transmembrane segment (S4) to control its con-
ductive state. Rosetta structural prediction demonstrates that the
S4 undergoes ∼3- to 5-Å transitional and lateral movements during
depolarization, which are coupled to opening of the channel pore.
Here both gating charges form state-dependent cation–π interac-
tions within the voltage sensor domain (VSD) during membrane de-
polarization. Our data demonstrate that the transfer of a single
gating charge per channel subunit is requisite for voltage, temper-
ature, and osmotic swell polymodal gating of TRPP2. Taken
together, we find that irrespective of stimuli, TRPP2 channel opening
is dependent on activation of its VSDs.

pubmed: 31315976, text: Discussion
VGICs and TRPP2 Channel Opening Requires Activation of the VSD.
VGICs open their ion conducting pores in response to changes in
membrane potential. This conformational change is preceded by
movement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage
sensors—a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical
impulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low
open probability with voltage stimulation alone and require
specific ligand interactions or other stimuli
to fully open.
Structural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML
channels suggest
their VSD-like domains form ligand
binding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation
(41–45). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical
mechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic
mediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in
general, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-
ered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that
TRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-
lated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial
gating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD
appears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel
opening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our
Rosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in
conjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-
cystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in
VGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural
features of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix
models (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-
rangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 Å across
the membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise
counter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar
and electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same
time, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-
tracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-
dues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is
activated (48).

expression and endocytosis [22,36–38,40,44]. α2δ subunits
are extracellular proteins that remain associated to the mem-

All K+ channels can discriminate between K+ and Na+,

such ion selectivity, channels would not be able to

by the selectivity filter, defined as the narrowest part of

In all K+ channel crystal structures solved so far, the main-

The channels are multisubunit complexes, being com-

complex that assembles the core of a Kv channel consist-

basic Kv channel properties such as opening and closing
(gating) of the pore in response to a change in the mem-
brane electric ﬁeld (60, 219, 283, 342). The activation
process is well described by a sequential gating model, in
which voltage-sensor movements in each Kv(cid:2)-subunit are
usually followed by a concerted pore opening step to
permit passage of K(cid:1). The details of conformational
changes associated with the electromechanical coupling-
mechanism between voltage sensor and activation gate
are presently under intense investigation (33, 153, 154,

Here we have sought
to characterize the functional properties of
channels composed of the human Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 subunits in the
absence and presence of auxiliary subunits such as human Kvb1.1 and
Kvb1.2. We have demonstrated that the hetero-oligomeric assemblies
of these subunits generate channels with distinct gating properties that
are profoundly modiﬁed by several mutations identiﬁed in the KCNA1
gene of EA1-affected patients.

Neurophysiological and disease implications

Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvb1.x subunits form the A-type potassium
channel. These channel types control the ﬁring properties of neurones
and their response to input stimuli (Connor & Stevens, 1971). The
functional properties of Kv1.4-1.1 ⁄ Kvb1.1 showed some similarities
with the potassium currents characterized by Geiger & Jonas (2000) in
hippocampal mossy ﬁbre boutons. However, some biophysical
parameters such as the inactivation V1 ⁄ 2 and refractory period are

pubmed: 12060745, text: The profound effects of Kv6.3 on Kv2.1 gating properties
suggest an important role for these heterotetramers: the latter
would be inactivated at potentials close to resting potential (V1⁄2
for inactivation is (cid:2)56 mV) in contrast to the homotetrameric
Kv2.1 channels (V1⁄2 (cid:3) (cid:2)16 mV). Because both subunits are
expressed in the brain (Fig. 2) functional heterotetramers could
exist (6, 17). Previous studies on the sustained delayed rectifier
component of hippocampal neurons showed properties that are
comparable with those of Kv2.1 and Kv6.3 heteromultimers (28,
29). At (cid:2)5 mV the two time constants for activation for the
current in those neurons were 53 ms and 190 ms, which is
comparable with heterotetrameric channels of Kv2.1 and Kv6.3
(Table 1). In addition, the midpoint of inactivation was more
negative ((cid:2)96 mV), which is at least closer to (cid:2)56 mV for Kv2.1
and Kv6.3 compared with (cid:2)16 mV for Kv2.1 alone. Further-
more, the pharmacological profile for homomeric Kv2.1 chan-
nels did not correspond completely with that of the sustained
delayed rectifier component: the TEA sensitivity depended on
the cell type under investigation (29) and differed from Kv2.1.
Thus native channels that are considered to contain Kv2 subunits
may well be heterotetramers, although it will be a challenge to
assign the proper heterotetrameric combination.
