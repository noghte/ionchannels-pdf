Results 1: No

0.7

1. The context questions the functional ability of 5-HT3D to form a ion channel.
   - "This raises the question of whether the 5-HT 3D subunit itself is able to form a functional ion channel."

2. Comparative expression analysis suggests possible complexity but does not confirm ion selectivity.
   - "We consider it likely that different subunit compositions of HTR3C, D, E as well as HTR3A and B in the 5-HT 3 receptor contribute to the complexity of the 5-HT 3 receptor system and therefore explain the varying properties of the respective proteins in different tissues."

"Except for the 5-HT 3 receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel, all serotonin receptors represent G-proteincoupled binding proteins."
