CLICs exist as soluble and membranous proteins [3],
and they interact with various other cytosolic proteins
[15]. As CLIC function was investigated by their
reconstitution in planar bilayers,
it is possible that
modulation of either channel permeability or selectivity
by cytoplasmic and membranous components present
inside an intact cell may have been overlooked. How-
ever, as the channel properties of CLIC5 have not
been reported to date, this reduced system has the
advantage of characterizing CLIC5 function in the
absence of modulatory factors. Furthermore, the role
of actin in regulating channel function is best observed
in such a reduced system considering the multiple and
the cytoskeleton performs in
contrasting roles that

Ion channel regulation by F-actin

pubmed: 17453412, text: CLIC4 is poorly-selective between anions and
cations,
inconsistent with the widely-adopted
‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature proposed by [18] and [40].
It may be necessary to re-evaluate CLIC proteins,
especially CLIC4, as ‘‘chloride’’ channels, if they
behave like non-selective channels. This could be
due to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.
However, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in
KCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as
found for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini
and Nonner
[41,42] noted similar paradoxical
behaviour in neuronal ‘‘background’’ Cl(cid:4) channels,
and suggested that anions and cations crossed the
membrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on
similar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4
contains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as
suggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-
meant anions could provide an opportunity for
counter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane
without encountering a prohibitive positive charge.
In a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the
presence of anions, and they must be sufficiently
small to penetrate the pore. Large,
impermeant
anions would prevent the passage of both anions
and cations (regardless of the latter’s size), whereas
large, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-
vent all ion permeation, but would make the channel
more anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we
noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the
presence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-
pared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable
to discriminate between a range of different anions,
again consistent with the idea that the pore itself is
poorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but
measurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],
so if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for
this difference (and the sequences are very similar, as
shown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that
detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative
TMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-

pubmed: 17453412, text: We also noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity
in fully-oxidized CLIC4 (exposed to 100 mM H2O2)
compared to the fully-reduced channel, although the
channel remains essentially very poorly-selective.
Oxidation of soluble CLIC1 induces a completely
new protein conformation involving intrachain dis-
ulphide bond formation and non-covalent associa-
tion into dimers [34], but a similar mechanism has
been ruled out for CLIC4 [12], so we speculate that
following membrane insertion the pore-lining re-
gions of CLIC4 remain the same irrespective of
oxidation or reduction. Instead, we suggest that the
difference in selectivity observed here could be due to
changes in the charged surface of the protein, away
from the putative TMD, that affect the channel
vestibule(s) or entrance(s). This suggestion is con-
sistent with experiments involving truncated CLIC4.

pubmed: 17453412, text: Abstract
Despite being synthesized in the cytosol without a leader sequence, the soluble 253-residue mammalian protein CLIC4
(Chloride Intracellular Channel 4, or p64H1), a structural homologue of V-type glutathione-S-transferase, autoinserts into
membranes to form an integral membrane protein with ion channel activity. A predicted transmembrane domain (TMD)
near the N-terminus of CLIC4 could mediate membrane insertion, and contribute to oligomeric pores, with minimal
reorganization of the soluble protein structure. We tested this idea by reconstituting recombinant CLIC4 in planar bilayers
containing phosphatidyethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, recording ion channels with a maximum
conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in KCl under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The channels discriminated poorly
between anions and cations, incompatible with the current ‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature, and their conductance was modified by
the trans (external or luminal) redox potential, as previously observed for CLIC1. We then reconstituted a truncated version
of the protein, limited to the first 61 residues containing the predicted TMD. This included a single trans cysteine residue in
the putative pore-forming subunits, at the external entrance to the pore. The truncated protein formed non-selective
channels with a reduced conductance, but they retained their trans -redox sensitivity, and could still be blocked or
inactivated by trans (not cis ) thiol-reative dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid. We suggest that oligomers containing the putative
TMD are essential components of the CLIC4 pore. However, the pore is inherently non-selective, and any ionic selectivity
in CLIC4 (and other membrane CLICs) may be attributable to other regions of the protein, including the channel
vestibules.

pubmed: 11551966, text: Formation of Chloride Ion Channels by CLIC1 in Lipid Bi-
layers—The fact that CLIC1 (and the CLICs) are cytoplasmic
as well as membrane proteins in distribution and appear to
contain the domains of a functional GSH-dependent redox pro-
tein structurally related to the GST superfamily raises the
question as to whether CLIC1 is a just a regulatory element
controlling an integral membrane ion channel. Several lines of
evidence indicate that the CLIC proteins exist in a true integral
membrane form. First, the CLIC4 fraction that partitions in
the membrane is resistant to alkali extraction (8, 18, 22).
Second, immunogold electron microscopy using an antibody
generated against an 18-amino acid peptide from the carboxyl
terminus of p62 shows that the protein is localized to the
osteoclast ruffled border membrane with 66% of the gold beads
within one bead diameter of the membrane (15). Also, our
previous studies using epitope-tagged CLIC1-transfected CHO
cells indicate that CLIC1 is a transmembrane protein that
directly forms part of the ion channel whose conductance is
blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the epitope tag. Further,
we could deduce that the amino terminus projects outward, and
the carboxyl terminus projects inward from the plasma mem-
brane (12), indicating that the protein spans the membrane an
odd number of times. Finally, a recent study (13) has shown
that recombinant CLIC1 can form chloride ion channels in lipid
bilayers, but the characteristics of the channels differed from
those measured in CHO cells transfected with CLIC1 (5, 12).
To evaluate the ability of our purified recombinant CLIC1 to
form ion channels we used the tip-dip electrophysiological tech-
nique (34, 44). Following bilayer formation on the patch pi-
pette, we added the purified recombinant CLIC1 to the bath

pubmed: 17453412, text: Our results suggest

CLIC4 forms poorly-selective, oligomeric ion chan-
nels modulated by luminal (or external) GSH-
dependent transthiolation. Its redox-sensitivity may
shed more light on the role of CLIC4 in apoptosis
[20], and at this stage it would be very helpful to
establish the stoichiometry of
the channel (the
tetramer in Figure 9 is entirely speculative), and
confirm the topology of its subunits. However, even
if CLIC4 monomers contain just a single TMD,
other parts of the protein may still contribute in
unanticipated ways to the ion channel pore. In
common with other transporters, a full understand-
ing of ion permeation through membrane CLICs,
and channel regulation by oxidation, awaits detailed
structural analysis. As an added complication, it will
be especially important to obtain membrane struc-
tures relevant to functional channels, with predict-
able electrophysiological properties, as opposed to
the structures of proteins that insert into membranes
without forming specific ion channels [23].

was obtained to measure the reversal potential. Voltage ramps from
−100 mV to +100 mV in 100 ms durations were applied. When the

Cs+, Na+, and Li+, respectively (Fig. 3D). The relative permeability

pore mutants by exchanges of charged amino acids (Fig. 4B).
Mutant H370D showed a different selectivity, in which gluco-

0.1. Mutant R366Q was more permeable to cations. The rever-
sal potential with isosmotic NaCl/CsCl shifted to 12.5 mV

Assuming that TEA and gluconate are impermeable ions, the
Na(cid:4)/Cs(cid:4)/Cl(cid:1) permeability ratio was calculated to be 0.7:0.25:1.
Thus, positively charged amino acids at positions 366 and 370
composed the pore of hTTYH3, playing a role in anion

Within the family of serotonin receptors, the 5-hydroxytrypta-

subunits are best characterized. Several studies, however,

discovery of multiple drugs targeting serotonin receptors, metabolising enzymes and re-uptake sites. During the past few years researchers
focussed especially on elucidating the complexity of different physiological actions in the serotonergic network. We have identiﬁed two
novel human serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor-like genes, HTR3D and HTR3E, by performing homology searches using the
public human sequence databases and subsequently cloned the full length cDNAs by 50 and 30 rapid ampliﬁcation of complementary DNA
ends. Mapping of HTR3D and HTR3E by hybridisation, polymerase chain reaction and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridisation revealed that both
genes together with HTR3C are clustered in a subinterval of less than 100 kb on chromosome 3q27. Comparative expression analysis of all
HTR3 genes, namely HTR3A, B, C, D and E showed HTR3D expression to be restricted to kidney, colon and liver and HTR3E expression to
colon and intestine, whereas all other genes are widely expressed in many tissues including brain.

All K+ channels can discriminate between K+ and Na+,
the most abundant alkali metal ions in nature. Without
such ion selectivity, channels would not be able to 
generate electrical signals. Selectivity for K+ is conferred
by the selectivity filter, defined as the narrowest part of
the conduction pathway in the open channel (FIG. 1c).
In all K+ channel crystal structures solved so far, the main-
chain carbonyl oxygens of the conserved K+ channel 
signature  sequence  (TXGYG  or  TXGFG), which  is
located in the P-loop, form the selectivity filter (FIG. 3).
Point mutations in the K+ channel signature sequence

experiments6,7,21–24. This work has been reviewed previ-
ously25 (FIG. 3). As the K+ channel signature sequence 
is conserved between all K+ channels, and the KcsA 
pore can substitute for the pore of other K+ channels26,
it is assumed that the mechanism of ion selectivity 
and permeation at the selectivity filter is similar in all 
K+ channels.

In Kir channels, structural features other than the 
K+ channel signature sequence are also important for K+
selectivity. Differences in the residues that surround 
the selectivity filter account for the reduced K+ selectivity
of Kir3.1 compared with other Kir3 family members27.
Certain mutations in the pore helix or in M2 of Kir3.2
cause a loss of K+ selectivity28. In most Kir channels,
a  SALT  BRIDGE between  conserved  charged  residues 
in adjacent subunits has been suggested to anchor
and stabilize the K+ channel signature sequence29–32.

Mutations of residues that line the ion conduction pathway of an ion channel usually 
significantly alter its ion selectivity. This concept has often been applied to test whether a 
protein is an ion channel-forming subunit36–38. On the other hand, mutations of non-pore 
lining regulatory proteins that even interact directly with ion channels rarely affect the 
channels' ion selectivity. To our knowledge, the only reported non-pore lining protein whose 
mutations affect a channel's ion selectivity is mink (KCNE1), a K+ channel regulatory 
subunit. In that case, however, only one residue was found that, when mutated, was able to 
increase the relative permeability of one ion (Na+) by 7 fold39.

Abstract

pubmed: 11368907, text: Potassium channels, the largest sub-family of the ion
channel superfamily, play important roles in a wide variety
of cells. Members of this channel family play critical roles
in cellular signalling processes regulating neurotransmitter
release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability,
epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction,
and cell volume regulation. K1 channels are membrane–
spanning proteins that selectively conduct K1 ions across
the cell membrane. Membrane depolarization activates
that, once opened,
voltage-gated potassium channels
conduct potassium ions along the concentration gradient
against the electric ﬁeld. This outward current leads to repo-
larization of the membrane. To accomplish this, K1 chan-
nels are endowed with a set of features: (1) a water-ﬁlled
permeation pathway (pore) that allows K1 ions to ﬂow
across the cell membrane; (2) a selectivity ﬁlter that speci-
ﬁes K1 ions as permeate ion species; (3) a gating mechan-

All K+ channels can discriminate between K+ and Na+,
the most abundant alkali metal ions in nature. Without
such ion selectivity, channels would not be able to 
generate electrical signals. Selectivity for K+ is conferred
by the selectivity filter, defined as the narrowest part of
the conduction pathway in the open channel (FIG. 1c).
In all K+ channel crystal structures solved so far, the main-
chain carbonyl oxygens of the conserved K+ channel 
signature  sequence  (TXGYG  or  TXGFG), which  is
located in the P-loop, form the selectivity filter (FIG. 3).
Point mutations in the K+ channel signature sequence
abolish K+ selectivity16. At the phenotypic level, this loss
of K+ selectivity is linked to the movement disorder that
is observed in weaver mice17–20.

pubmed: 32494638, text: The NALCN channel complex is selective for  
monovalent cations
To define the ion selectivity profile of the NALCN channel complex, 
we first determined the current-carrying ions under bi-ionic condi-
tions. We found that current directionality and reversal potentials 
(Erevs) were sensitive to substitution of either extracellular or intracel-
lular Na+ with the large cation N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+), but 
not to replacement of extracellular Cl− with the large anion methane-
sulfonate (MS−) (Fig. 2A), consistent with permeability for cations 
and not anions. Next, we assessed the permeability of different cat-
ions [Li+, K+, Cs+, TEA+ (tetraethylammonium), Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+] 
by having equimolar concentrations of test cations on the extracel-
lular side [150 mM for monovalent cations (X+); 110 mM for divalent 
cations (X2+)] and the impermeable NMDG+ (150 mM) on the in-
tracellular side. We observed voltage-dependent currents in the 
presence of extracellular Li+, K+, or Cs+, but not with TEA+ or X2+ 
(Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+; Fig. 2B). The maximal current amplitudes of Li+, K+, 
and Cs+ elicited at −80 mV, however, were smaller compared to Na+ 
(57 ± 8%, 89 ± 11%, and 76 ± 11% of Na+ current, respectively). To 
measure the Erevs of the permeable cations, we ran a ramp protocol 
from −80 to +80 mV. The permeability ratios (PNa/PX) calculated on 
the basis of the Erevs revealed a permeability sequence of Na+ ≈ 
Li+ > K+ > Cs+ (Fig. 2C). This permeability sequence was altered to 
Na+ ≈ Li+ ≈ K+ > Cs+ when the putative SF motif of NALCN (EEKE) 
was mutated to that of NaVs (DEKA; Fig. 2D).

experiments6,7,21–24. This work has been reviewed previ-
ously25 (FIG. 3). As the K+ channel signature sequence 
is conserved between all K+ channels, and the KcsA 
pore can substitute for the pore of other K+ channels26,
it is assumed that the mechanism of ion selectivity 
and permeation at the selectivity filter is similar in all 
K+ channels.

In Kir channels, structural features other than the 
K+ channel signature sequence are also important for K+
selectivity. Differences in the residues that surround 
the selectivity filter account for the reduced K+ selectivity
of Kir3.1 compared with other Kir3 family members27.
Certain mutations in the pore helix or in M2 of Kir3.2
cause a loss of K+ selectivity28. In most Kir channels,
a  SALT  BRIDGE between  conserved  charged  residues 
in adjacent subunits has been suggested to anchor
and stabilize the K+ channel signature sequence29–32.

Mutations of residues that line the ion conduction pathway of an ion channel usually 
significantly alter its ion selectivity. This concept has often been applied to test whether a 
protein is an ion channel-forming subunit36–38. On the other hand, mutations of non-pore 
lining regulatory proteins that even interact directly with ion channels rarely affect the 
channels' ion selectivity. To our knowledge, the only reported non-pore lining protein whose 
mutations affect a channel's ion selectivity is mink (KCNE1), a K+ channel regulatory 
subunit. In that case, however, only one residue was found that, when mutated, was able to 
increase the relative permeability of one ion (Na+) by 7 fold39.

Here we have sought
to characterize the functional properties of
channels composed of the human Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 subunits in the
absence and presence of auxiliary subunits such as human Kvb1.1 and
Kvb1.2. We have demonstrated that the hetero-oligomeric assemblies
of these subunits generate channels with distinct gating properties that
are profoundly modiﬁed by several mutations identiﬁed in the KCNA1
gene of EA1-affected patients.

Neurophysiological and disease implications

Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvb1.x subunits form the A-type potassium
channel. These channel types control the ﬁring properties of neurones
and their response to input stimuli (Connor & Stevens, 1971). The
functional properties of Kv1.4-1.1 ⁄ Kvb1.1 showed some similarities
with the potassium currents characterized by Geiger & Jonas (2000) in
hippocampal mossy ﬁbre boutons. However, some biophysical
parameters such as the inactivation V1 ⁄ 2 and refractory period are

pubmed: 20393197, text: Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels selectively
catalyze the transport of K(cid:1) across the plasma membrane.
The channels are multisubunit complexes, being com-
posed of membrane-integrated Kv(cid:2)-subunits and of ac-
cessory subunits. Kv(cid:2)-subunits form a tetrameric protein
complex that assembles the core of a Kv channel consist-
ing of a pore domain with activation (and inactivation)
gate(s) and selectivity ﬁlter linked to peripheral voltage-
sensor domains. In in vitro expression systems, most
Kv(cid:2)-subunits form functional Kv channels, reproducing
basic Kv channel properties such as opening and closing
(gating) of the pore in response to a change in the mem-
brane electric ﬁeld (60, 219, 283, 342). The activation
process is well described by a sequential gating model, in
which voltage-sensor movements in each Kv(cid:2)-subunit are
usually followed by a concerted pore opening step to
permit passage of K(cid:1). The details of conformational
changes associated with the electromechanical coupling-
mechanism between voltage sensor and activation gate
are presently under intense investigation (33, 153, 154,
282).

TRPP2 and VGICs Share a Voltage-Dependent Gating Mechanism. A
cardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents
activated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion
flow during the transition from the open to closed states in the
whole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly
found in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have
previously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29–31). In the
symmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-
cell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-
ate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a
Boltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal
voltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =
47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is
shallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately
1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Based on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that
TRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-
ment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and
TRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25–
28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)
structurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions

pubmed: 31315976, text: The opening of voltage-gated ion channels is initiated by transfer
of gating charges that sense the electric field across the mem-
brane. Although transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP)
are members of this family, their opening is not intrinsically linked
to membrane potential, and they are generally not considered
voltage gated. Here we demonstrate that TRPP2, a member of the
polycystin subfamily of TRP channels encoded by the PKD2L1
gene, is an exception to this rule. TRPP2 borrows a biophysical riff
from canonical voltage-gated ion channels, using 2 gating charges
found in its fourth transmembrane segment (S4) to control its con-
ductive state. Rosetta structural prediction demonstrates that the
S4 undergoes ∼3- to 5-Å transitional and lateral movements during
depolarization, which are coupled to opening of the channel pore.
Here both gating charges form state-dependent cation–π interac-
tions within the voltage sensor domain (VSD) during membrane de-
polarization. Our data demonstrate that the transfer of a single
gating charge per channel subunit is requisite for voltage, temper-
ature, and osmotic swell polymodal gating of TRPP2. Taken
together, we find that irrespective of stimuli, TRPP2 channel opening
is dependent on activation of its VSDs.

mammalian members, which all function as Ca2(cid:1) entry channels gated by a variety
of physical and chemical stimuli. TRPV4, which displays 45% sequence identity
with TRPV1, is characterized by a surprising gating promiscuity: it is activated by
hypotonic cell swelling, heat, synthetic 4(cid:2)-phorbols, and several endogenous
substances including arachidonic acid (AA), the endocannabinoids anandamide and
2-AG, and cytochrome P-450 metabolites of AA, such as epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids. This review summarizes data on TRPV4 as a paradigm of gating diversity in
this subfamily of Ca2(cid:1) entry channels.
