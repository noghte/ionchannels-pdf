A widely held and extensively tested prediction of channel-forming proteins is that \nmutating residues lining the ion conduction pathway significantly alters the ion selectivity \n(not simply current amplitude) of the channel. Based on amino acid sequence alignment \n(Fig. 2a), a pore-forming loop has been proposed to exist between the last two \ntransmembrane segments in both TRPP3 and PKD1L328.

To\nresolve how hAQP10 is pH-gated, structural studies were initiated\nusing polyhistidine (His)-tagged protein. However, full-length\nhAQP10 yielded no crystals and we continued with a variant\n(\u03941\u201310,\n(hAQP10cryst; Fig. 2a)\n\u0394278\u2013301) that crystallized at pH 6.0 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The\nstructure was determined at 2.3 \u00c5 resolution (Table 1), and\nreveals a tetramer fold highly reminiscent of other AQPs\n(Fig. 2b), with each monomer formed by six transmembrane\nhelices (TM1\u2013TM6) establishing a conducting channel (Fig. 2c).\nStrikingly, the region typically linked to selectivity in AQPs, the\naromatic and arginine (ar/R) selectivity \ufb01lter at the non-cytosolic\nend of the pore21, is signi\ufb01cantly wider (2.6 \u00c5) than in previously\nstructurally characterized AQPs (Fig. 2c, d), as also found by\nHOLE analyses22. Furthermore, no glycerol molecule was iden-\nti\ufb01ed at the ar/R \ufb01lter, in contrast to the only available structure\nof a eukaryotic aquaglyceroporin, PfAQP (Fig. 2c, d)17. These\nobservations indicate that the functional role of the ar/R region\nmay not be maintained in hAQP10 (the ar/R \ufb01lter of orthodox\naquaporins is typically very tight, excluding glycerol passage,\nwhereas in aquaglyceroporins it also permits \ufb02ow of certain small\nsolutes, but prevents most other compounds (Supplementary\nFig. 1)23. A single glycerol molecule is instead located adjacent to\nthe AQP archetypical, central NPA-motif (N82\u2013A84) in hAQP10\n(Fig. 2c, e, Supplementary Fig. 4b). This area and the presence of\nNPA glycerol molecule are highly conserved elements among\nstructurally determined aquaglyceroporins (including GlpF and\nAqpM; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5)15,16. However, toward the\ncytoplasm the glycerol molecule is rather positioned close to the\nunique F85 of loop B in hAQP10 (invariant as a valine/isoleucine\nin other AQPs). F85 has a side-chain con\ufb01guration unfavorable\nfor glycerol passage,\nforming a unique mechanistic feature.\nMoreover, the entire cytoplasmic pore region has adapted a tight\narrangement not previously observed, achieved by the \ufb01rst part of\nloop B (G73-H80; loop layout likely allowed by the hAQP10-\nspeci\ufb01c G73G74-motif; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1) with\nV76-S77 capping the cytoplasmic opening, F85, and R94 (of\nTM3), which seemingly stabilizes loop B in the closed con\ufb01g-\nuration. Notably, HOLE analysis suggests that this narrowing\n(0.9 \u00c5) permits water (0.8 \u00c5 at the ar/R \ufb01lter in hAQP2)22, but\nnot glycerol (1.3 \u00c5 in AqpM)16 \ufb02ux, in agreement with the pro-\nteopolymersome data at relatively high pH. The most likely pH-\nsensor candidate in the region is H80, which lines the pore and\nstructurally links loop B, F85 and R94. pH-dependent gating\nmechanisms have been proposed for human AQP3, 4 and 5\nrefs18,24,25, but the available structures are open (for hAQP4 the\nH80 equivalent was pinpointed as a gate, but loop B in hAQP4\nhas a signi\ufb01cantly different con\ufb01guration as compared to\nhAQP10)26,27.

In addition, the full tetrameric crystal\nstructure of HsAQP5 gives us the best\ninterfacial alignment\nbetween the associated monomers and therefore, makes the\nhuman aquaporin 5 the perfect candidate to investigate the gating\nmechanism of mammalian aquaporins.",

In addition, the kinetics of gating is\nalso changed by the addition of Ca2+. ANO9 activation by cAMP in\nCa2+ free condition needs time lag after making whole-cells. In con-\ntrast, with high intracellular [Ca2+], cAMP activated the channel al-\nmost immediately after the formation of whole-cells. In addition, the\nrate of activation by cAMP is also changed when Ca2+ is added. For\nexample, without Ca2+, cAMP abruptly activated the channel (Figs. 1B\nand 3A). However, when high Ca2+ is added, cAMP slowly activated\nthe channel (Fig. 5B). Thus, the role of Ca2+ in activating ANO9 cannot\nbe ignored because Ca2+ a\ufb00ected the ANO9 activity. Recently, the X-\nray crystal structure of nhTMEM16 was determined [49]. The Glu re-\nsidues of ANO1 essential for its activation by Ca2+ were located in the\nsubunit cavity of ANO1 in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The\nsubunit cavity was lined with four glutamates, an aspartate and an\nasparagine residue in the \u03b1-helices 6, 7, and 8 of ANO1. These helices\nare known to be crucial for the channel activation of ANO1 and the\nscramblase activity of nhTMEM16 [49]. ANO9 has a similar amino-acid\nsequence in this region (Fig. 5A): ANO9 has four glutamates, an as-\npartate and a serine residue in the \u03b1-helices 6, 7 and 8. This structural\nconstraint of ANO9 compared to ANO1 predicts the synergistic but not\nessential role of Ca2+ in activating ANO9.

(Suppl Fig.\u00a07), an alternative or concurrent mechanism that might have explained the cur-\nrent density increase after ionomycin application. Removal of the first transmembrane domain of Ano4 (Ano4-1-\n1150del-GFP) led to a significant reduction of both membrane localization (as demonstrated by a reduction of the \nPCC between pan Cadherin and Ano4) and density of Ca2+-evoked currents (Fig.\u00a01H\u2013J). In addition, membrane \nlocalization of Ano4-GFP was further demonstrated via a biotinylation assay (Suppl. Fig.\u00a04E). The rather small \ncurrent density increases in cells transfected with GFP-tagged full length Ano4 (less than 3 fold) compared to \ntransfection with untagged Ano4 (more than 25 fold, Fig.\u00a01C) might be explained by the GFP tag hampering or \ninterfering with channel activity.

Membrane currents were \nrecorded in ARPE-19 cells in the whole-cell configuration, with a higher Cl\u2212 concentration in the bath than that \nin the pipette solution. Ionomycin application led to the activation of a membrane conductance with a reversal \npotential of \u22121.7 mV, indicating the activation of cation conductance (Fig.\u00a05B\u2013E). Comparable currents were \ntransiently activated in response to application of 500 \u00b5M ATP (Fig.\u00a05F\u2013H). At the peak of their activation, \nthese currents showed almost linear current/voltage relationships with a reversal potential of 0 mV.

(Suppl Fig.\u00a07), an alternative or concurrent mechanism that might have explained the cur-\nrent density increase after ionomycin application. Removal of the first transmembrane domain of Ano4 (Ano4-1-\n1150del-GFP) led to a significant reduction of both membrane localization (as demonstrated by a reduction of the \nPCC between pan Cadherin and Ano4) and density of Ca2+-evoked currents (Fig.\u00a01H\u2013J). In addition, membrane \nlocalization of Ano4-GFP was further demonstrated via a biotinylation assay (Suppl. Fig.\u00a04E). The rather small \ncurrent density increases in cells transfected with GFP-tagged full length Ano4 (less than 3 fold) compared to \ntransfection with untagged Ano4 (more than 25 fold, Fig.\u00a01C) might be explained by the GFP tag hampering or \ninterfering with channel activity.

The calculation of the relative conductance for K+ (Fig.\u00a02D,E) revealed weak selectivity, \nwith a conductance sequence of K+ > Na+ > Li+, which is consistent with Eisenman I\u2013VI permeability sequences. \nThus, several lines of evidence demonstrate that Ano4 elicited Ca2+-dependent cation conductance.",

(Suppl Fig.\u00a07), an alternative or concurrent mechanism that might have explained the cur-\nrent density increase after ionomycin application. Removal of the first transmembrane domain of Ano4 (Ano4-1-\n1150del-GFP) led to a significant reduction of both membrane localization (as demonstrated by a reduction of the \nPCC between pan Cadherin and Ano4) and density of Ca2+-evoked currents (Fig.\u00a01H\u2013J). In addition, membrane \nlocalization of Ano4-GFP was further demonstrated via a biotinylation assay (Suppl. Fig.\u00a04E). The rather small \ncurrent density increases in cells transfected with GFP-tagged full length Ano4 (less than 3 fold) compared to \ntransfection with untagged Ano4 (more than 25 fold, Fig.\u00a01C) might be explained by the GFP tag hampering or \ninterfering with channel activity.

In addition, the kinetics of gating is\nalso changed by the addition of Ca2+. ANO9 activation by cAMP in\nCa2+ free condition needs time lag after making whole-cells. In con-\ntrast, with high intracellular [Ca2+], cAMP activated the channel al-\nmost immediately after the formation of whole-cells. In addition, the\nrate of activation by cAMP is also changed when Ca2+ is added. For\nexample, without Ca2+, cAMP abruptly activated the channel (Figs. 1B\nand 3A). However, when high Ca2+ is added, cAMP slowly activated\nthe channel (Fig. 5B). Thus, the role of Ca2+ in activating ANO9 cannot\nbe ignored because Ca2+ a\ufb00ected the ANO9 activity. Recently, the X-\nray crystal structure of nhTMEM16 was determined [49]. The Glu re-\nsidues of ANO1 essential for its activation by Ca2+ were located in the\nsubunit cavity of ANO1 in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The\nsubunit cavity was lined with four glutamates, an aspartate and an\nasparagine residue in the \u03b1-helices 6, 7, and 8 of ANO1. These helices\nare known to be crucial for the channel activation of ANO1 and the\nscramblase activity of nhTMEM16 [49]. ANO9 has a similar amino-acid\nsequence in this region (Fig. 5A): ANO9 has four glutamates, an as-\npartate and a serine residue in the \u03b1-helices 6, 7 and 8. This structural\nconstraint of ANO9 compared to ANO1 predicts the synergistic but not\nessential role of Ca2+ in activating ANO9. Voltage has been found to be\nanother endogenous activator of ANO1 and ANO2, but, analogous to\nthe role of Ca2+, ANO9 was not activated by voltage alone (Fig. 3F and",

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore.

Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

A predicted transmembrane domain (TMD)\nnear the N-terminus of CLIC4 could mediate membrane insertion, and contribute to oligomeric pores, with minimal\nreorganization of the soluble protein structure. We tested this idea by reconstituting recombinant CLIC4 in planar bilayers\ncontaining phosphatidyethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, recording ion channels with a maximum\nconductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in KCl under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The channels discriminated poorly\nbetween anions and cations, incompatible with the current \u2018\u2018CLIC\u2019\u2019 nomenclature, and their conductance was modified by\nthe trans (external or luminal) redox potential, as previously observed for CLIC1. We then reconstituted a truncated version\nof the protein, limited to the first 61 residues containing the predicted TMD. This included a single trans cysteine residue in\nthe putative pore-forming subunits, at the external entrance to the pore. The truncated protein formed non-selective\nchannels with a reduced conductance, but they retained their trans -redox sensitivity, and could still be blocked or\ninactivated by trans (not cis ) thiol-reative dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid. We suggest that oligomers containing the putative\nTMD are essential components of the CLIC4 pore. However, the pore is inherently non-selective, and any ionic selectivity\nin CLIC4 (and other membrane CLICs) may be attributable to other regions of the protein, including the channel\nvestibules.",

Although the aspartate at position\nAsp-50 was indispensable for divalent cation-dependent gating\nof Cx30 hemichannels, substitutions of the two other residues\nhad no significant effect on gating, illustrating differences in the\ngating mechanisms between connexin isoforms.

Of the cysteine-sub-\nstituted residues, interaction of a proposed pore-lining cysteine\nat position 37 with the positively charged compound [2-(trim-\nethylammonium)ethyl] methane thiosulfonate bromide (MTS-\nET) increased Cx30-mediated currents with unperturbed\nethidium permeability.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore. Large,\nimpermeant\nanions would prevent the passage of both anions\nand cations (regardless of the latter\u2019s size), whereas\nlarge, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-\nvent all ion permeation, but would make the channel\nmore anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

According\nto the simple pore model, the aqueous mobilities should de-\ntermine the monovalent ion selectivity sequence. Based on\nthe relative aqueous mobilities of all permeant ions (K+ = 1,\nCs' = 1.05, TEA' = 0.44, Cl- = 1.04, and glutamate- =\n0.36), a 38% increase in maximum yj of the Cx37 channel\nwas expected with the substitution of IPS #3 for IPS#2.

According\nto the simple pore model, the aqueous mobilities should de-\ntermine the monovalent ion selectivity sequence. Based on\nthe relative aqueous mobilities of all permeant ions (K+ = 1,\nCs' = 1.05, TEA' = 0.44, Cl- = 1.04, and glutamate- =\n0.36), a 38% increase in maximum yj of the Cx37 channel\nwas expected with the substitution of IPS #3 for IPS#2. One\npossible explanation for the experimentally observed 20%\nincrease in yj is to assign a relative anion/cation permeability\nof 0.43, which reduces the relative glutamate-/K+ and\nCl-/K+ permeabilities to 0.15 and 0.45, respectively. Given\nthe experimental variability in the yj measurements due to the\nopen channel variance and range of Tj values obtained with\neach IPS, the IPS #3/IPS #2 conductance ratios may range\nfrom 1.12 to 1.25. The corresponding relative anion/cation\npermeability estimates for the Cx37 channel range from 0.32\nto 0.66. It is interesting that our Cx37 channel data agree\nclosely with previous relative Cl-/K+ conductance and per-\nmeability estimates of 0.52-0.69 from rat lacrimal gland cell\nand earthworm median giant axon gap junction channels with\ndiverse protein compositions (Neyton and Trautmann, 1985;\nBrink and Fan, 1989).",

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore. Large,\nimpermeant\nanions would prevent the passage of both anions\nand cations (regardless of the latter\u2019s size), whereas\nlarge, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-\nvent all ion permeation, but would make the channel\nmore anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

Panx1 channels open in response to a rise of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) that leads to ATP release and stimulation of P2X1 on platelets. (c) \nEnzymatic cleavage- The intracellular C-terminus of Panx1 contains a zymogen site that is cleaved by caspase-3, removing an auto inhibitory domain, facilitating \nchannel activation and ATP release. (d) Mechanical stimulation- Mechanical deformation and elevated shear stress have been shown to stimulate Panx1 channels. \nStudies of cardiac muscle report increased expression of Cx43 following sustained exposure to shear stress. (e) Protein trafficking- Connexins are expressed at the \nplasma membrane for relatively short periods (half-life (T1/2) = 1.5\u20133 hours) and are trafficked and recycling in response to cellular activation. Panx1 is stably \nexpressed at the plasma membrane with a T1/2 of approximately 24 hours. Created in BioRender.",

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore. Large,\nimpermeant\nanions would prevent the passage of both anions\nand cations (regardless of the latter\u2019s size), whereas\nlarge, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-\nvent all ion permeation, but would make the channel\nmore anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

The cytoplasmic loop (CL)\nand arginines of a COOH-terminal domain (CT1) of con-\nnexin32 (Cx32) were shown to determine CO2 sensitivity, and\na gating mechanism involving CL-CT1 association-dissocia-\ntion was proposed.

In tandems, two Cx32 monomers are linked NH2-to-\nCOOH terminus. In 5R/E and 5R/N mutants, glutamates or\nasparagines replace CT1 arginines. On the basis of the\nintriguing sensitivity of the mutant-32 channel to Vj polarity,\nthe existence of a \u2018\u2018slow gate\u2019\u2019 distinct from the conventional Vj\ngate is proposed.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins).

Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore.

Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

The anomalous difference electron density map\ncontained a 10 \u03c3 peak for Ba2+ in the external site, consistent with the assessment that it is a\nbinding site for Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). Ba2+ is positioned slightly farther away from the glutamate\nring than Ca2+ and this correlates with the ionic radii of the ions (1.35 \u00c5 for Ba2+ and 0.99\n\u00c5 for Ca2+). It is possible that the ion coordination, which could be either direct or water-\nmediated, is not six-fold symmetric due to the flexibility of glutamate side chains. The\nbackbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu 178 at the C-terminal end of M1 might also contribute to\nCa2+ binding (Fig. 4A). To investigate if Gd3+ blocks the channel by binding to the same\nsite, diffraction data were collected from crystals soaked in Gd3+, which also has a strong\nanomalous diffraction signal. The anomalous difference electron density map showed a 14 \u03c3\npeak for Gd3+ in the external site (Fig. 4B). The density is positioned closer to the glutamate\nring than for Ca2+ and this may be indicative of the high affinity of Gd3+ and its +3 charge.\nNotably, the single Ca2+ binding site identified is located just outside the pore rather than\nwithin it. This configuration of ion binding distinguishes Orai from K+ channels, which have\nmultiple ions present within the pore in their structures (34), and this likely reflects\ndifferences in the mechanisms for ion permeation and selectivity.",

Although this process of \u2018store operated Ca2+ entry\u2019 has been recognized for\ndecades, Orai and STIM, the CRAC channel pore and its regulator, were identified fairly\nrecently (2-7). Orai, located in the plasma membrane, forms the Ca2+ pore and there are\nthree Orai proteins in humans (Orai1-3) (8-10). A mutation in Orai1 that renders the channel\nnon-conductive (R91W) (11) causes a form of immune deficiency, underscoring its\nimportance in the immune system (5). STIM is a single-pass membrane protein in the ER\nthat senses the luminal Ca2+ concentration. It opens the pore of Orai following Ca2+ store\ndepletion, probably via interaction between the cytosolic portions of STIM and Orai, which\naccumulate at ER-plasma membrane junctions (reviewed in (1, 12)).",

The ~ 10,000 fold resting concentration gradient of Ca2+ across the\nplasma membrane (~ 1 mM extracellular and ~ 100 nM intracellular [Ca2+]) must be\nmaintained to prevent aberrant Ca2+ signaling within cells, and therefore Orai must be\ntightly sealed shut when it is closed. Anion(s) bound in the basic region probably help serve\nthis purpose. In an open conformation, the basic region would tend to prevent the\npermeation of cations that have modest concentration gradients (such as K+ and Na+, which\nhave ~ 50 fold gradients) and in this way it would contribute to Ca2+-selective permeation\nunder physiological conditions. In order to establish a slow permeation rate that prevents\noverloading of the cell with Ca2+ and allows for fine tuning of sustained Ca2+ signals, the\nchannel imposes energy barriers to ion permeation, which could include dissociation of Ca2+\nfrom the selectivity filter (into the pore), permeation through the hydrophobic section, and\nelectrostatic repulsion by the basic section. Ultimately, the channel's design takes advantage",

However, some evidence, including an anomalous\nmole fraction effect (33), suggests that there may be more than one Ca2+ binding site. A\nsecond binding site might account for the property that while Na+ currents through CRAC\nchannels are blocked by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, Ca2+ does not appreciably flow\nuntil the external solution contains millimolar concentrations of it (19, 20). Additionally, the\nextent of blockage of Na+ current at micromolar levels of Ca2+ is dependent on the voltage\napplied across the membrane (~ 10% block at -20 mV and ~ 50% block at -80 mV with 20\n\u03bcM external Ca2+) (36, 38), which suggests that an ion binding site is located within the\nvoltage gradient, whereas the external site would probably be located outside of it.",

The ability of Orai3 to rescue Ca2+ entry\nfollowing knockdown of Orai1 may indicate that Orai3 is expressed at a more modest (perhaps\nphysiological) level than Orai1, or that it can function together with limited remaining Orai1.\nAdditional experiments will be needed to distinguish among these, or other possibilities.\nNonetheless, the clear augmentation of entry by Orai3 in this particular situation demonstrates\nthat this gene product can also play a role in the generation or regulation of store-operated\nCa2+ entry.",

As a striking difference to\nthe other hHCNs, however, hHCN3 channels were not modulated by\nintracellular cAMP. Direct modulation of the activation kinetics by\ncAMP is a remarkable feature of the other three HCN channels (4 \u20139).\nThe mechanism of the cAMP modulation has been partially elucidated\n(12). HCN channels possess a cyclic nucleotide binding domain, located\nin the intracellular C terminus. The C terminus inhibits activation of the\nchannel by an as yet unknown interaction with the core region. Upon\nbinding of cAMP, this inhibition is released, resulting in less energy\ndemand for channel activation, leading to faster activation and a shift of\nthe activation to more positive activation potentials (12). cAMP-de-\npendent modulation is best observed with hHCN2 and hHCN4,\nwhereas hHCN1 is modulated only moderately. It has to be pointed out\nthat the voltage-dependent activation curve of hHCN1 is already at (cid:10)20\nmV more positive potentials than that of hHCN2/4 in the absence of\ncAMP, indicating that the inhibition by the C terminus is much less in\nthe first place, and thus, release of inhibition has a less pronounced\neffect. The activation curve of hHCN3 is close to that of hHCN1 chan-\nnels, suggesting that the inhibition by the C terminus is weak. Interest-\ningly, V1\u20442 and (cid:2)\n1 values of the hHCN3 channels are almost identical with\nthose for the cAMP-modulated hHCN4 channel, supporting the notion\nthat the C terminus of hHCN3 channels has a weak control on channel\nactivation.",

After our discovery of further\nputative 5-HT3 serotonin receptor-encoding genes, HTR3C,\nHTR3D, and HTR3E, we investigated whether these novel can-\ndidates and the isoform 5-HT3Ea are able to form functional\n5-HT3 receptor complexes. Using immunofluorescence and im-\nmunoprecipitation studies of heterologously expressed pro-\nteins, we found that each of the respective candidates coas-\nsembles with 5-HT3A.

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining a-helices is the principal motion\ndetermining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of\nbiochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the\nreceptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining a-helices is the principal motion\ndetermining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of\nbiochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the\nreceptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining a-helices is the principal motion\ndetermining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of\nbiochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the\nreceptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

In this study, we present the 2.4 \u00c5 resolu-\ntion crystal structure of the monomeric \u03b23 ECD, which revealed rather distinctive loop C features as\ncompared to those of \u03b1 nAChR subunits, leading to intramolecular stereochemical hindrance of the\nbinding site cavity. Vigorous molecular dynamics simulations in the context of full length pentameric\n\u03b23-containing nAChRs, while not excluding the possibility of a \u03b23 (+) binding site, demonstrate that\nthis site cannot ef\ufb01ciently accommodate the agonist nicotine. From the structural perspective, our\nresults endorse the accessory rather than functional role of the \u03b23 nAChR subunit, in accordance\nwith earlier functional studies on \u03b23-containing nAChRs.",

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining a-helices is the principal motion\ndetermining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of\nbiochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the\nreceptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

Although these efforts do not exclude the possibility that \u03b23 could bind ligands, they are indicative that under the particular exper-imental conditions, the \u03b23 ECD monomer cannot contribute significantly to the binding affinity of ligands. This is in contrast to previous structural studies on \u03b1 nAChR ECDs (in particular on \u03b11 [20], \u03b19 [18,21] and \u03b12 [22] nAChR ECDs) where the monomeric ECD held sufficient capacity to bind strongly to common antagonists or agonists and in one case the ligand even induced the homo-pentamerization of \u03b12 ECD [22]. 1.2. MD Simulations of \u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b14\u03b22\u03b23 nAChRs With the aim to investigate the structural observations obtained by the X-ray struc-ture of the ECD of \u03b23 under physiological conditions, we have carried out classical MD simulations of pentameric \u03b14\u03b22-containing nAChRs comprising \u03b23, in a lipid bilayer with explicit solvent (Figure 2A). The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the \u03b14\u03b22 subtype of the nAChR in 2\u03b1:3\u03b2 stoichiometry (PDB ID: 6cnj) [25] was used as a template for the preparation of two systems, one with the native high sensitivity \u03b14\u03b22 receptor, (\u03b14)2(\u03b22)3, and another, where one \u03b22 subunit was replaced by \u03b23, producing the \u03b14/\u03b22/\u03b23/\u03b14/\u03b22 stoichiometry (hereafter (\u03b14\u03b22)2\u03b23).

The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, at the neuromuscular junction,\nis a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel that has been fine-tuned through evolution to\ntransduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal with maximum efficiency and speed.\nIt is composed from three similar and two identical polypeptide chains, arranged in a ring\naround a narrow membrane pore. Central to the design of this assembly is a hydrophobic gate\nin the pore, more than 50 A\u02da away from sites in the extracellular domain where ACh binds.\nAlthough the molecular properties of the receptor have been explored intensively over the\nlast few decades, only recently have structures emerged revealing its complex architecture and\nilluminating how ACh entering the binding sites opens the distant gate. Postsynaptic\nmembranes isolated from the (muscle-derived) electric organ of the Torpedo ray have\nunderpinned most of the structural studies : the membranes form tubular vesicles having\nreceptors arranged on a regular surface lattice, which can be imaged directly in frozen\nphysiological solutions. Advances in electron crystallographic techniques have also been\nimportant, enabling analysis of the closed- and open-channel forms of the receptor in\nunreacted tubes or tubes reacted briefly with ACh. The structural differences between these\ntwo forms show that all five subunits participate in a concerted conformational change\ncommunicating the effect of ACh binding to the gate, but that three of them (ac, b and d)\nplay a dominant role. Flexing of oppositely facing pore-lining a-helices is the principal motion\ndetermining the closed/open state of the gate. These results together with the findings of\nbiochemical, biophysical and other structural studies allow an integrated description of the\nreceptor and of its mode of action at the synapse.",

This could lead\nto more energetic stabilization of the untilting of the M2 helix and the\nclosing of the pore. Therefore, we hypothesize that the binding of the\nantagonist strychnine to GlyRa3 induces the opening of loop C and\nthe orthosteric binding pocket, which further facilitates the inward\ndisplacement of the M2\u2013M3 loop and the tilting of the M2 helix\ntowards the pore, ultimately leading to closing of the channel pore\n(Fig. 5).",

ASIC gating occurs on a \nmillisecond time scale8 and can be largely described by a simple mechanism composed of three \nstates: high pH resting, low pH open and low pH desensitized9. While previously solved x-ray \nstructures of ASIC1a elucidated the conformations of the open10 and desensitized1,11 states, the \nstructure of the high pH, resting state as well as detailed mechanisms for activation and \ndesensitization have remained elusive. Here we present resting state structures of homotrimeric \nchicken ASIC1a at high pH determined by x-ray crystallography and single particle cryo-electron \nmicroscopy, informing a comprehensive molecular mechanism for proton-dependent gating in \nASICs. In the resting state, the thumb domain has moved outward relative to its position in the \nopen and desensitized states, expanding the \u2018acidic pocket\u2019. Activation thus involves \u2018closure\u2019 of \nthe thumb into the acidic pocket, expansion of the lower palm domain and an iris-like opening of \nthe channel gate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the \u03b211-\u03b212 linkers demarcating upper and \nlower palm domains serve as a molecular \u2018clutch\u2019, undergoing a simple rearrangement to permit \nrapid desensitization.",

The mechanism by which\nCa2 \u00fe exerts its effect has been the subject of intense inves-\ntigation resulting in the identi\ufb01cation of several Ca2 \u00fe binding\nsites in the InsP3R (Sienaert et al, 1997). In addition to a\ndirect action of Ca2 \u00fe on the receptor, Ca2 \u00fe may function\nthrough Ca2 \u00fe -sensing proteins that either bind directly to or\nmodify channel activity by the addition/removal of second-\nary modi\ufb01cations such as phosphate groups (Patel et al, 1999;\nThrower et al, 2001; Nadif Kasri et al, 2002; Taylor and Laude,\n2002; Roderick and Bootman, 2003). The tetra EF-hand-\ncontaining Ca2 \u00fe sensor protein calmodulin (CaM) has been\nshown to modulate the activity of InsP3Rs in both a Ca2 \u00fe -\ndependent and -independent manner (Reviewed in Nadif\nKasri et al, 2002; Taylor and Laude, 2002). The Ca2 \u00fe -inde-\npendent CaM binding domain has been mapped to two\nnoncontiguous sites in the NH2-terminal 159 amino acids\n(aa) of the type 1 InsP3R (InsP3R1) (Sienaert et al, 2002). The\ninteraction of CaM with these sites was shown to decrease\nthe af\ufb01nity of the receptor for InsP3 (Sienaert et al, 2002). The\ninhibition of InsP3-induced Ca2 \u00fe release (IICR) by CaM-like\nproteins may have great signi\ufb01cance in neurons where it has\nbeen shown to underlie processes including axonal guidance,\ngrowth cone formation as well as excitability, which govern\nlong-term potentiation and depression (LTD) associated with\nmemory formation (Nakamura et al, 1999; Nagase et al,\n2003). The propagation of Ca2 \u00fe release following repetitive\nstimulation of the parallel \ufb01bre/Purkinje cell synapses is\ngenerally restricted to the postsynaptic spines. This is surpris-\ning, since Purkinje cells abundantly express InsP3Rs through-\nout the cell (Snyder and Supattapone, 1989; Volpe et al,\n1991). Thus, it has been proposed that the high levels of\nCaM also present in these cells (B10 mM; Kakiuchi et al,\n1982) decrease IICR and restrict excitability (Cardy and\nTaylor, 1998).",

CaBP/caldendrin, a sub-\nfamily of the EF-hand-containing neuronal calcium sensor family of\ncalmodulin-related proteins, bind speci\ufb01cally to the InsP3-binding\nregion of all three InsP3R channel isoforms with high af\ufb01nity (Ka (cid:1)\n25 nM) in a Ca2(cid:1)-dependent manner (Ka (cid:1) 1 (cid:2)M). Binding activates\nsingle-channel gating as ef\ufb01caciously as InsP3, dependent on func-\ntional EF-hands in CaBP. In contrast, calmodulin neither bound with\nhigh af\ufb01nity nor activated channel gating. CaBP1 and the type 1\nInsP3R associate in rat whole brain and cerebellum lysates, and\ncolocalize extensively in subcellular regions in cerebellar Purkinje\nneurons. Thus, InsP3R-mediated Ca2(cid:1) signaling in cells is possible\neven in the absence of InsP3 generation, a process that may be\nparticularly important in responding to and shaping changes in\nintracellular Ca2(cid:1) concentration by InsP3-independent pathways\nand for localizing InsP3-mediated Ca2(cid:1) signals to individual\nsynapses.",

The peak current has been associated with the\nactivation of an endogenous Ca2+-dependent chloride chan-\nnel (31) resulting from calcium influx through NMDA recep-\ntors (32). The current amplitude depends on the extracellular\ncalcium concentration (Fig. 4): a 10-fold increase of calcium\nconcentration augmented both the peak and the plateau\ncurrents. In contrast, bathing the oocyte in Ba2+-Ringer\nsolution (in the absence of Ca2+) prevents occurrence of the\ntransient component, slightly reduces amplitude of the\nsteady-level current (Fig. 4), and shifts reversal potential\ntoward more positive values (data not shown). The chloride\nchannel blockers, flufenamic (100 ,uM) and niflumic acid (100\n,M) (32), attenuated the transient component of the L-glu-\ntamate-evoked inward currents in Ca2+-Ringer solution (data\nnot shown) and, as in Ba2+-Ringer solution, the current\nreversed at positive potentials (Fig. SC). Taken together,\nthese results suggest that the fast desensitizing component of\nthe L-glutamate-activated currents is accounted for, at least\nin part, by the activation of endogenous calcium-dependent\nchloride channels consequent to Ca2+ influx through hNR1\nreceptor channels and, therefore, indicate that homomeric\nhNR1 receptor channels are permeable to Ca2+, as are the\nnatural NMDA-sensitive receptors in neurons (3, 7).",

First-pass attempts to explain the glutamate-elicited\ncurrents with mathematical models produced reaction mechanisms that included only the\nmost basic functionally de\ufb01ned states: resting vs. liganded, closed vs. open, responsive vs.\ndesensitized. In contrast, single-molecule observations afforded by the patch-clamp technique\nrevealed an unanticipated kinetic multiplicity of transitions: from microseconds-lasting \ufb02ickers\nto minutes-long modes. How these kinetically de\ufb01ned events impact the shape of the synaptic\nresponse, how they relate to rearrangements in receptor structure, and whether and how they\nare physiologically controlled represent currently active research directions. Modal gating, which\nrefers to the slowest, least frequently observed ion-channel transitions, has been demonstrated for\nrepresentatives of all ion channel families. However, reaction schemes have been largely con\ufb01ned\nto the short- and medium-range time scales. For glutamate receptors as well, modal gating has\nonly recently come under rigorous scrutiny. This article reviews the evidence for modal gating of\nglutamate receptors and the still developing hypotheses about the mechanism(s) by which modal\nshifts occur and the ways in which they may impact the time course of synaptic transmission.",

In this re- \nport, we describe the cloning of a cDNA encoding a human \nglutamate ionotropic receptor subunit protein from a hu- \nman hippocampal library. This cDNA, termed humEAAl , is \nmost closely related to rat and human cDNAs for kainate \nreceptor proteins and, when expressed in COS or Chinese \nhamster  ovary cells, is associated with  high-affinity kai- \nnate receptor binding. We have successfully established \ncell lines stably expressing humEAAl . This is the first re- \nport of establishment of stable cell lines expressing a glu- \ntamate  receptor  subunit.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins). Franciolini\nand Nonner\n[41,42] noted similar paradoxical\nbehaviour in neuronal \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 Cl(cid:4) channels,\nand suggested that anions and cations crossed the\nmembrane at least partly as counter ions. Based on\nsimilar ideas, if the putative pore lining of CLIC4\ncontains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as\nsuggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-\nmeant anions could provide an opportunity for\ncounter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane\nwithout encountering a prohibitive positive charge.\nIn a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the\npresence of anions, and they must be sufficiently\nsmall to penetrate the pore. Large,\nimpermeant\nanions would prevent the passage of both anions\nand cations (regardless of the latter\u2019s size), whereas\nlarge, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-\nvent all ion permeation, but would make the channel\nmore anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we\nnoted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the\npresence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-\npared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable\nto discriminate between a range of different anions,\nagain consistent with the idea that the pore itself is\npoorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but\nmeasurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],\nso if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for\nthis difference (and the sequences are very similar, as\nshown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that\ndetailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative\nTMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal\nvoltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =\n47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is\nshallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately\n1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).\nBased on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that\nTRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-\nment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and\nTRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25\u2013\n28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)\nstructurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal\nvoltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =\n47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is\nshallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately\n1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).\nBased on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that\nTRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-\nment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and\nTRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25\u2013\n28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)\nstructurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal\nvoltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =\n47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is\nshallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately\n1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).\nBased on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that\nTRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-\nment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and\nTRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25\u2013\n28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)\nstructurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions",

For ex-\nample, KCNE1 and KCNE3 both increase surface expression and current\ndensity, while KCNE4 and KCNE5 have no e\ufb00ect on current density\n[151]. KCNE2 and KCNE3 interaction with Kv7.1 produces voltage-in-\nsensitive channels and all KCNEs depolarise the activation voltage of\nKv7, with KCNE4 and KCNE5 depolarising activation to a non-physio-\nlogical membrane potential [151]. KV7.1 has a well-established role in\ncardiac rhythm and in regulating osmotic and salt transport across\ngastrointestinal, cochlear and renal epithelia; this is re\ufb02ected in Kcne1\nknockout mice demonstrating atypical QT intervals, hair cell degen-\neration, impaired renal \ufb02uid, glucose and electrolyte uptake, and faecal\nNa+ and K+ wasting [152\u2013155]. Furthermore, mutations in KCNE1\nunderlie Long QT Syndrome 5 and Jervis and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,\na disorder characterised by deafness and cardiac arrhythmia [156,157].\nWith regard to cancer, KCNE1-3 are expressed in uterine cancer cell\nlines, in which they in\ufb02uence proliferation [158] and a 5-fold and 3-\nfold upregulation of KCNE3 and KCNE4 respectively has been reported\nin gliobastoma datasets [159]. Paradoxical to the upregulation of\nKCNE1 in uterine cancer cell lines, KCNE1 overexpression in an astro-\nglioma cell line (U87-MG) induces apoptosis and KCNE1 is one of the\nfour genes deleted in the 21q22.12 microdeletion which causes a pre-\ndisposition to acute myelogenous leukaemia [160,161]. The apoptotic\nin\ufb02uence of KCNE1 in U87-MG cells is proposed to occur through ca-\nnonical K+ e\ufb04ux through Kv7.1, inducing decreased cytoplasmic K+, a\nknown apoptotic trigger [160,162], whereas KCNE1 induces uterine\ncancer cell proliferation via modulation of HERG channels [158,163].\nHERG channels induce proliferation in a range of cell lines and HERG\nchannel inhibition decreases MAPK phosphorylation and c-fos expres-\nsion in MDA-MB-435S cells [164]. Out of all the Kv auxiliary subunits\nhowever, KCNE2 has the most established link to cancer. KCNE2\ndownregulation is observed in gastric cancer tissue and gastric cancer\ncell lines, correlates with gastritis cystica profunda development (pre-\nneoplastic condition characterised by large gastric cysts) and is a risk\nfactor in gastric cancer strati\ufb01cation [165\u2013167]. Furthermore, Kcne2\nknockout mice display a 6-fold increase in stomach size, an upregula-\ntion of Ki67 and Cyclin D1 in gastric mucosa, an increase in the me-\ntaplastic marker TFF2, pyloric adenomas and neoplastic invasion\ncompared to wild-type mice [168]. Overexpression of KCNE2 in the\nSGC7901 gastric cancer cell line reduces proliferation and signi\ufb01cantly\nreduces xenograft tumour volume compared to parental SGC7901 cells\n[167].",

Oxida-\ntive cross-linking (38) of designed double-cysteine mutants was\nexpected to restrain the conformation of the voltage-sensitive\nhelix TM4 relative to other adjacent transmembrane helix (e.g.,\nTM1, TM5, and TM6) upon disulfide formation, and thus lock\nthe channel in a closed state (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the V127C/\nT217C (TM4\u2013TM6) pair mutants resulted in a small but non-\nnegligible shift in the SDS/PAGE upon CuP-promoted oxida-\ntion, indicating interhelical disulfide formation of C127/C217\nwithin the protomer (Fig. 6D). Just as expected, the V127C/\nT217C double mutant does not show any channel opening, even\nat voltages higher than +50 mV, most likely because the C127/\nC217 disulfide bond locks the voltage-sensing TM4 helix in a\nrestrained conformation, thus causing the channel to remain\nclosed upon depolarization.

We found that PKC specifically eliminates rapid inactivation of a cloned human\nA-type K+ channel (hKv3.4), converting this channel from a rapidly inactivating A type to a\nnoninactivating delayed rectifier type. Biochemical analysis showed that the N-terminal domain of\nhKv3.4 is phosphorylated in vitro by PKC, and mutagenesis experiments revealed that two serines\nwithin the inactivation gate at the N-terminus are sites of direct PKC action. Moreover, mutating one\nof these serines to aspartic acid mimics the action of PKC. Serine phosphorylation may thus prevent\nrapid inactivation by shielding basic residues known to be critical to the function of the inactivation\ngate. The regulatory mechanism reported here may have substantial effects on signal coding in the\nnervous system.\n\nIntroduction",

In the\nquaternary channel structure, the activation of the VSDs is coupled\nto a concerted 4-fold displacement of the S6 cytosolic gate, which\ndilates the PD enough to allow the passage of ions (3, 9). There are\ntypically 4 highly conserved positively charged residues (arginine or\nlysine), called \u201cgating charges,\u201d at every third amino acid position\nwithin the S4 (6, 10). Based on structural, computational, and\nfunctional studies, these gating charge residues form sequential\nstabilizing electrostatic bonds within the VSD which catalyze the\nS4 segment\u2019s outward translocation in response to membrane de-\npolarization (11\u201313).",

At the same\ntime, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-\ntracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-\ndues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is\nactivated (48).",

Voltage-dependent opening or gating of\nVGICs is tightly controlled by the up or down state (activated or\ndeactivated) of the S4 transmembrane segment (5, 6).

KCNE2 and KCNE3 interaction with Kv7.1 produces voltage-in-\nsensitive channels and all KCNEs depolarise the activation voltage of\nKv7, with KCNE4 and KCNE5 depolarising activation to a non-physio-\nlogical membrane potential [151]. KV7.1 has a well-established role in\ncardiac rhythm and in regulating osmotic and salt transport across\ngastrointestinal, cochlear and renal epithelia; this is re\ufb02ected in Kcne1\nknockout mice demonstrating atypical QT intervals, hair cell degen-\neration, impaired renal \ufb02uid, glucose and electrolyte uptake, and faecal\nNa+ and K+ wasting [152\u2013155]. Furthermore, mutations in KCNE1\nunderlie Long QT Syndrome 5 and Jervis and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,\na disorder characterised by deafness and cardiac arrhythmia [156,157].\nWith regard to cancer, KCNE1-3 are expressed in uterine cancer cell\nlines, in which they in\ufb02uence proliferation [158] and a 5-fold and 3-\nfold upregulation of KCNE3 and KCNE4 respectively has been reported\nin gliobastoma datasets [159]. Paradoxical to the upregulation of\nKCNE1 in uterine cancer cell lines, KCNE1 overexpression in an astro-\nglioma cell line (U87-MG) induces apoptosis and KCNE1 is one of the\nfour genes deleted in the 21q22.12 microdeletion which causes a pre-\ndisposition to acute myelogenous leukaemia [160,161]. The apoptotic\nin\ufb02uence of KCNE1 in U87-MG cells is proposed to occur through ca-\nnonical K+ e\ufb04ux through Kv7.1, inducing decreased cytoplasmic K+, a\nknown apoptotic trigger [160,162], whereas KCNE1 induces uterine\ncancer cell proliferation via modulation of HERG channels [158,163].\nHERG channels induce proliferation in a range of cell lines and HERG\nchannel inhibition decreases MAPK phosphorylation and c-fos expres-\nsion in MDA-MB-435S cells [164]. Out of all the Kv auxiliary subunits\nhowever, KCNE2 has the most established link to cancer. KCNE2\ndownregulation is observed in gastric cancer tissue and gastric cancer\ncell lines, correlates with gastritis cystica profunda development (pre-\nneoplastic condition characterised by large gastric cysts) and is a risk\nfactor in gastric cancer strati\ufb01cation [165\u2013167]. Furthermore, Kcne2\nknockout mice display a 6-fold increase in stomach size, an upregula-\ntion of Ki67 and Cyclin D1 in gastric mucosa, an increase in the me-\ntaplastic marker TFF2, pyloric adenomas and neoplastic invasion\ncompared to wild-type mice [168].

KCNE2 and KCNE3 interaction with Kv7.1 produces voltage-in-\nsensitive channels and all KCNEs depolarise the activation voltage of\nKv7, with KCNE4 and KCNE5 depolarising activation to a non-physio-\nlogical membrane potential [151]. KV7.1 has a well-established role in\ncardiac rhythm and in regulating osmotic and salt transport across\ngastrointestinal, cochlear and renal epithelia; this is re\ufb02ected in Kcne1\nknockout mice demonstrating atypical QT intervals, hair cell degen-\neration, impaired renal \ufb02uid, glucose and electrolyte uptake, and faecal\nNa+ and K+ wasting [152\u2013155]. Furthermore, mutations in KCNE1\nunderlie Long QT Syndrome 5 and Jervis and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,\na disorder characterised by deafness and cardiac arrhythmia [156,157].\nWith regard to cancer, KCNE1-3 are expressed in uterine cancer cell\nlines, in which they in\ufb02uence proliferation [158] and a 5-fold and 3-\nfold upregulation of KCNE3 and KCNE4 respectively has been reported\nin gliobastoma datasets [159]. Paradoxical to the upregulation of\nKCNE1 in uterine cancer cell lines, KCNE1 overexpression in an astro-\nglioma cell line (U87-MG) induces apoptosis and KCNE1 is one of the\nfour genes deleted in the 21q22.12 microdeletion which causes a pre-\ndisposition to acute myelogenous leukaemia [160,161]. The apoptotic\nin\ufb02uence of KCNE1 in U87-MG cells is proposed to occur through ca-\nnonical K+ e\ufb04ux through Kv7.1, inducing decreased cytoplasmic K+, a\nknown apoptotic trigger [160,162], whereas KCNE1 induces uterine\ncancer cell proliferation via modulation of HERG channels [158,163].\nHERG channels induce proliferation in a range of cell lines and HERG\nchannel inhibition decreases MAPK phosphorylation and c-fos expres-\nsion in MDA-MB-435S cells [164]. Out of all the Kv auxiliary subunits\nhowever, KCNE2 has the most established link to cancer. KCNE2\ndownregulation is observed in gastric cancer tissue and gastric cancer\ncell lines, correlates with gastritis cystica profunda development (pre-\nneoplastic condition characterised by large gastric cysts) and is a risk\nfactor in gastric cancer strati\ufb01cation [165\u2013167]. Furthermore, Kcne2\nknockout mice display a 6-fold increase in stomach size, an upregula-\ntion of Ki67 and Cyclin D1 in gastric mucosa, an increase in the me-\ntaplastic marker TFF2, pyloric adenomas and neoplastic invasion\ncompared to wild-type mice [168].

Voltage-dependent opening or gating of\nVGICs is tightly controlled by the up or down state (activated or\ndeactivated) of the S4 transmembrane segment (5, 6).

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our\nRosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in\nconjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-\ncystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in\nVGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural\nfeatures of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix\nmodels (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-\nrangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 \u00c5 across\nthe membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise\ncounter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar\nand electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13).

                    "text": "Discussion\nVGICs and TRPP2 Channel Opening Requires Activation of the VSD.\nVGICs open their ion conducting pores in response to changes in\nmembrane potential. This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our\nRosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in\nconjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-\ncystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in\nVGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural\nfeatures of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix\nmodels (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-\nrangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 \u00c5 across\nthe membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise\ncounter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar\nand electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same\ntime, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-\ntracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-\ndues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is\nactivated (48).",

One\nTTX-R sodium channel, termed SNS [12] and PN3 [13], was\ninitially cloned from the rat, with subsequent cloning of its\nmouse and human cognates [14,15]. A second TTX-R sodium\nchannel, initially termed NaN [16] and subsequently termed\nSNS2 [17], has been cloned from the rat and the mouse DRG\n[18]. Here we report the sequence of the human cognate of\nNaN, and show the presence of two distinct TTX-R sodium\ncurrents, one with properties that correspond to those re-\nported for SNS, and the other with novel properties, in hu-\nman DRG neurons.",

The mutation, D1866Y, alters an evolutionarily conserved aspartate residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic\ndomain of the sodium channel (cid:2)subunit. The mutation decreased modulation of the (cid:2)subunit by (cid:1)1, which normally causes a negative\nshift in the voltage dependence of inactivation in oocytes. There was less of a shift with the mutant channel, resulting in a 10 mV difference\nbetween the wild-type and mutant channels in the presence of (cid:1)1. This shift increased the magnitude of the window current, which\nresulted in more persistent current during a voltage ramp. Computational analysis suggests that neurons expressing the mutant channels\nwill fire an action potential with a shorter onset delay in response to a threshold current injection, and that they will fire multiple action\npotentials with a shorter interspike interval at a higher input stimulus. These results suggest a causal relationship between a positive shift\nin the voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation and spontaneous seizure activity. Direct interaction between the cytoplasmic\nC-terminal domain of the wild-type (cid:2)subunit with the (cid:1)1 or (cid:1)3 subunit was first demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The SCN1A\npeptide K1846-R1886 is sufficient for (cid:1)subunit interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation from transfected mammalian cells confirmed the\ninteraction between the C-terminal domains of the (cid:2)and (cid:1)1 subunits. The D1866Y mutation weakens this interaction, demonstrating a\nnovel molecular mechanism leading to seizure susceptibility.",

The mutation, D1866Y, alters an evolutionarily conserved aspartate residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic\ndomain of the sodium channel (cid:2)subunit. The mutation decreased modulation of the (cid:2)subunit by (cid:1)1, which normally causes a negative\nshift in the voltage dependence of inactivation in oocytes. There was less of a shift with the mutant channel, resulting in a 10 mV difference\nbetween the wild-type and mutant channels in the presence of (cid:1)1. This shift increased the magnitude of the window current, which\nresulted in more persistent current during a voltage ramp. Computational analysis suggests that neurons expressing the mutant channels\nwill fire an action potential with a shorter onset delay in response to a threshold current injection, and that they will fire multiple action\npotentials with a shorter interspike interval at a higher input stimulus. These results suggest a causal relationship between a positive shift\nin the voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation and spontaneous seizure activity.

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A).

However,\nunder conditions of Ca2(cid:1) overload, type 3 RyR was activated by\ncaffeine or local increases in [Ca2(cid:1)]i (28). These impressive\nstudies showed for the first time by a molecular approach the\nfunction of the different RyR subtypes in portal vein smooth\nmuscle cells. However, a disadvantage of the experimental\nstrategy of Macrez and co-workers (20) was that only a limited\nnumber of cells could be injected with antisense oligomers,\nmaking Western blot analysis of the proteins impossible. In\naddition, no stable cell lines were established, requiring re-\npeated laborious injections of antisense oligomers. A different\napproach toward the IP3R was carried out by Marks and col-\nleagues (19): Jurkat T cells were stably expressed with a vector,\nallowing for constitutive expression (pREP10) containing a\nfragment of the human type 1 IP3R in antisense orientation.\nAlthough the proliferation rate of these cells decreased by\nabout 75%, it was impressively demonstrated that deletion of\nthe IP3R almost completely impaired TCR/CD3-mediated Ca2(cid:1)\nsignaling but not capacitative Ca2(cid:1) signaling activated by the\nsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular Ca2(cid:1) ATPase inhibitor\nthapsigargin (19). These important results suggest that (i) the\nwhole machinery of T cell Ca2(cid:1) signaling depends on rapid,\nIP3-mediated Ca2(cid:1) release in the first minutes of T cell activa-\ntion and that (ii) additional Ca2(cid:1) channels are present in\nJurkat T cells allowing for passive Ca2(cid:1) leak from the endo-\nplasmic reticulum in case of thapsigargin stimulation. Both\nresults were confirmed recently: microinjection of the IP3 an-\ntagonist D-myo-inositol 1,4,6-phosphorothioate before TCR/\nCD3 stimulation completely abolished Ca2(cid:1) signaling (2),\nwhereas microinjection a few minutes after the first Ca2(cid:1) spike\nhad no effect (2), confirming that IP3 acts to deliver the first\nglobal Ca2(cid:1) responses, which are then used as co-activators of\nthe subsequent systems. Secondly, the expression of additional\nintracellular Ca2(cid:1) release channels that would carry the leak\ncurrent from the endoplasmic reticulum of type 1 IP3R-defi-\ncient cells in case of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular Ca2(cid:1)\nATPase inhibition was demonstrated: on the one hand, the\nexpression of types 2 and 3 IP3R was almost unaltered by the\ntype 1 IP3R-specific antisense construct (29), and on the other\nhand, sufficient evidence for RyR expression in Jurkat T cells\nhas been obtained in the meantime (2, 10 \u201318).",

Previous investigations have defined\nspecific structural rearrangements associated with the transition of the RyR1 channel from a\nclosed to an open conformation; these include separation of domains 9 and 10 in the\ncytoplasmic clamp region of the channel and the appearance of a central opening in the\ntransmembrane region.36 The interaction of CLIC2 with the closed RyR1 channel induces a\nseparation of domains 9 and 10 of the molecule but no equivalent changes in the transmembrane\nregion. The cryo-electron microscopy results on RyR1-CLIC2, albeit at too low a resolution\nto provide a molecular mechanism of CLIC2\u2019s effects on RyR1, nevertheless show structural\nfeatures that have previously been attributed to the open and to the closed forms of the\nchannel35,36 that might be related to the biochemical/functional assays that showed\ncharacteristics of both \u201copen\u201d (in the clamp regions) and \u201cclosed\u201d (in the central region of the\ntransmembrane domain) channel states in the RyR1-CLIC2 complex. We suggest that the\nbinding of CLIC2 to the closed RyR1 induces a conformational change that resembles the\n\u201copen\u201d configuration in the clamp-shaped region of RyR1, which may facilitate the association\nof ryanodine to the binding site, and consequently increase its [3H]-ryanodine binding affinity.\nHowever, the binding of CLIC2 to domain 5 and domain 6 of RyR1 concurrently strengthens\nthe interaction between these two domains, thereby minimizes domain switch unzipping and\nstabilizes the closed state of the RyR1 channel, and consequently reduces the rate of Ca2+ efflux\nfrom skeletal heavy SR.",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration.

We report\nthat hTRPA1 with and without its N-terminal ARD (\u03941\u2013688 hTRPA1)\nis intrinsically cold-sensitive, and thus, cold-sensing properties of\nhTRPA1 reside outside the N-terminal ARD. We show activation\nof hTRPA1 by the thiol oxidant 2-((biotinoyl)amino)ethyl methane-\nthiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) and that electrophilic compounds ac-\ntivate hTRPA1 in the presence and absence of the N-terminal ARD.\nThe nonelectrophilic compounds menthol and the cannabinoid \u03949-\ntetrahydrocannabiorcol (C16) directly activate hTRPA1 at different\nsites independent of the N-terminal ARD. The TRPA1 antagonist\nHC030031 inhibited cold and chemical activation of hTRPA1 and\n\u03941\u2013688 hTRPA1, supporting a direct interaction with hTRPA1 out-\nside the N-terminal ARD. These findings show that hTRPA1 is an\nintrinsically cold- and chemosensitive ion channel. Thus, second\nmessengers, including Ca2+\n, or accessory proteins are not needed\nfor hTRPA1 responses to cold or chemical activators. We suggest\nthat conformational changes outside the N-terminal ARD by cold,\nelectrophiles, and nonelectrophiles are important in hTRPA1 chan-\nnel gating and that targeting chemical interaction sites outside the\nN-terminal ARD provides possibilities to fine tune TRPA1-based\ndrug therapies (e.g., for treatment of pain associated with cold\nhypersensitivity and cardiovascular disease).",

Current conducted by TRP family members is often rectifying,\nbut this form of voltage dependence is usually attributed to divalent\nblock or other conditional effects (17, 18). There are 3 members of\nthe polycystin subclass: TRPP1 (PKD2 or polycystin-2), TRPP2\n(PKD2-L1 or polycystin-L), and TRPP3 (PKD2-L2).

Although transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP)\nare members of this family, their opening is not intrinsically linked\nto membrane potential, and they are generally not considered\nvoltage gated. Here we demonstrate that TRPP2, a member of the\npolycystin subfamily of TRP channels encoded by the PKD2L1\ngene, is an exception to this rule. TRPP2 borrows a biophysical riff\nfrom canonical voltage-gated ion channels, using 2 gating charges\nfound in its fourth transmembrane segment (S4) to control its con-\nductive state.

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal\nvoltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =\n47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is\nshallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately\n1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).\nBased on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that\nTRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-\nment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and\nTRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25\u2013\n28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)\nstructurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions",

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our\nRosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in\nconjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-\ncystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in\nVGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural\nfeatures of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix\nmodels (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-\nrangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 \u00c5 across\nthe membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise\ncounter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar\nand electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same\ntime, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-\ntracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-\ndues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is\nactivated (48).",

It is notable from a plot of V1/2 vs. log [Ca2+\n]i\nthat the V1/2 shifts caused by LRRC52 and LRRC55 in the pres-\nence of different concentrations of [Ca2+\n]i (0.76\u201326 \u03bcM) are on\naverage \u223c36 mV smaller than in the absence of [Ca2+\n]i (Fig. 3 A\u2013\nC), suggesting a modi\ufb01cation in the apparent calcium sensitivity of\nBK channels by these two regulatory LRR proteins. According to\nthe commonly used voltage and calcium-dependent allosteric\ngating model of BK channel activation, the apparent calcium\nsensitivity, which is de\ufb01ned as the slope in the V1/2 vs. log [Ca2+\n]i\nplot, can be affected by either a real change in microscopic calcium\nsensitivity (binding or allosteric coupling) or a modi\ufb01cation in the\nvoltage-related gating parameters (18, 19). Because the latter may\nresult in a change in the shape of the normalized conductance vs.\nvoltage (G\u2013V) curve, a plot of the QappV1/2 vs. log [Ca2+\n]i was used\nto estimate whether the BK channel\u2019s microscopic calcium sensi-\ntivity is affected by these LRRC26 paralogs. Both V1/2 and Qapp\n(apparent gating charge) are determined from a single Boltzmann\nfunction \ufb01t of the G\u2013V curve (Table S1). A nonlinear relationship\n]i was observed when all [Ca2+\nbetween the QappV1/2 vs. log [Ca2+\n]i\nconditions are included for plotting. As shown in Fig. 3D,\nLRRC26\u2019s three paralogs all cause slight changes in the relation-\nship between QappV1/2 and log [Ca2+\n]i, e.g., a slope change of\n\u223c20% by LRRC52 and LRRC38 and of \u223c40% by LRRC55 from\n0.76 to 4.2 \u03bcM [Ca2+\n]i, suggesting some effects on the microscopic\ncalcium sensitivity of BK channel activation. However, further\ndetailed investigation in the context of the allosteric gating\nmechanism of BK channel activation by voltage and Ca2+\nwill be\nneeded to separate the effects on Ca2+\n- and voltage-activation\npathways. Consistent with the different capabilities in inducing G\u2013\n+\nV shifts, LRRC26 and its paralogs modify the BK channel\u2019s K\ncurrent kinetics to different extents (Fig. S3). LRRC26 and its\nthree paralogs all greatly increase the activation rates of BK\nchannel currents. Additionally, LRRC26, LRRC52, and LRRC55\n(at positive voltages) signi\ufb01cantly decelerate channel deactiva-\ntion, whereas a slight acceleration effect was also observed for\nLRRC38 and LRRC55 (at negative voltages).",

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli.

This could be\ndue to a wide pore lacking specific ion-binding sites.\nHowever, a maximum conductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in\nKCl is inconsistent with a wide water-filled pore (as\nfound for example in bacterial porins).

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our\nRosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in\nconjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-\ncystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in\nVGICs.

Oxida-\ntive cross-linking (38) of designed double-cysteine mutants was\nexpected to restrain the conformation of the voltage-sensitive\nhelix TM4 relative to other adjacent transmembrane helix (e.g.,\nTM1, TM5, and TM6) upon disulfide formation, and thus lock\nthe channel in a closed state (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the V127C/\nT217C (TM4\u2013TM6) pair mutants resulted in a small but non-\nnegligible shift in the SDS/PAGE upon CuP-promoted oxida-\ntion, indicating interhelical disulfide formation of C127/C217\nwithin the protomer (Fig. 6D). Just as expected, the V127C/\nT217C double mutant does not show any channel opening, even\nat voltages higher than +50 mV, most likely because the C127/\nC217 disulfide bond locks the voltage-sensing TM4 helix in a\nrestrained conformation, thus causing the channel to remain\nclosed upon depolarization.

We found that functional ex-\npression of NALCN in both heterologous systems requires UNC79, \nUNC80, and FAM155A (Fig.\u00a01A and fig. S1). Furthermore, rat NALCN \n(4),  human  FAM155B,  and  mouse  FAM155A  (12)  orthologs  can \nfunctionally substitute human NALCN and FAM155A, respectively \n(fig. S1B).

The Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse \northologs have previously been suggested to reside in the endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) and facilitate NALCN trafficking.

Recent findings have implicated two proteins,\nStim1 and Orai1, as having essential roles in store-operated Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane.\nHowever, transient overexpression of these proteins on their own results in little or no increase in\nstore operated entry. Here we demonstrate dramatic synergism between these two mediators; co-\ntransfection of HEK293 cells with Stim1 and Orai1 results in an approximate 20-fold increase in\nstore-operated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-selective current. This demonstrates that these two proteins are\nlimiting for both the signaling and permeation mechanisms for Ca2+-selective store-operated Ca2+\nentry. There are three mammalian homologs of Orai1, and in expression experiments they all\nproduced or augmented store-operated Ca2+ entry with efficacies in the order Orai1 > Orai2 > Orai3.\nStim1 apparently initiates the signaling process by acting as a Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic\nreticulum. This results in rearrangement of Stim1 within the cell and migration toward the plasma\nmembrane to regulate in some manner Orai1 located in the plasma membrane. However, we\ndemonstrate that Stim1 does not incorporate in the surface membrane, and thus likely regulates or\ninteracts with Orai1 at sites of close apposition between the plasma membrane and an intracellular\nStim1-containing organelle.",

                    "text": "Overall, these data provide some perspectives on the role of\nSTIM1 in SOC activation. Recent studies have indicated that\nSTIM1 functions within the ER as a Ca2(cid:1) sensor and becomes\ntranslocated toward the PM (7\u20139). After store depletion, STIM1 is\nreorganized in the ER into vesicular structures, or puncta, close to\nthe PM (8). Although it was first reported that there was no\nevidence of STIM1 insertion into the PM (8), subsequent biotiny-\nlation experiments revealed some STIM1 appearing at the cell\nsurface after sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2(cid:1) ATPase\n(SERCA) pump inhibition (9). An insertional model based on this\ninformation is depicted in Fig. 5 A\u2013D. The blocking effect of the\nSTIM1 Ab shown here provides strong evidence that STIM1 has a\nfunctional presence in the PM. However, as yet there are no data\nto support the hypothesis that translocation of STIM1 into the PM\nis required for the activation of SOCs. Indeed, there has previously\nbeen little evidence to support any role for vesicle trafficking in the\nactivation of SOCs (5, 6, 17). Importantly, the earlier studies of\nDziadek and coworkers (14, 15) revealed that a significant propor-\ntion of STIM1 is in the PM in normal cells. Indeed, using N-terminal\nSTIM1 Abs, our FACS analysis of STIM1 expression in normal and\nSTIM1-overexpressing cells revealed a substantial presence of\nSTIM1 in the PM (data not shown). Here, the use of the N-terminal\nmAb to block SOC function involved treating cells with Ab and then\nremoving the Ab before measurement of CRAC or SOC activity.\nThus, the Ab likely is targeting preexisting STIM1 in the PM.\nCompatibly with the insertional model, it is possible that Ab bound\nto preexisting PM STIM1 might have a dominant modifying action\non the formation or function of the STIM1 multimers required for\nSOC activation. It is established that STIM1 can form multimers\nand that the C-terminal coiled-coil region mediates this interaction\n(15). However, without the information that STIM1 insertion is\nrequired for SOC activation, we could also consider an alternative\nmodel. Thus, although some insertion of STIM1 into the PM may\nbe measurable upon store emptying, it is possible that this is not\nrequired for the activation of SOCs. Instead, as shown as an\nalternative model in Fig. 5 A, B, E, and F, channel activation may\nresult from an \u2018\u2018influence\u2019\u2019 of the reorganized ER STIM1 molecules\non the PM, through interactions with preexisting PM STIM1\nmolecules and possibly the entry channel itself. Thus, through a\nconformational coupling process, aggregated STIM1 molecules on\nthe ER may activate the entry channels without necessarily becom-\ning inserted into the PM. Such a conformational coupling model\nwould provide a simpler explanation of the STIM1 Ab results and\nwould be compatible with much earlier speculation and evidence\nthat close interactions, but not necessarily fusion, between the ER\nand PM are involved in the activation of SOCs (5, 6, 18\u201320).",

Store-dependent activation can be\ndemonstrated both in patch-clamp experiments when cells are perfused with InsP3 (Fig. 3A)\nor when store depletion is caused by ionomycin (Fig. 3C), which both result in rapid\nactivation of CRAC currents. SOCE is also evident in [Ca2+]i imaging experiments in intact\ncells when cells are stimulated with an InsP3-mobilizing agonist and blocking store refilling\nwith thapsigargin (Fig. 6). The main difference between CRAC in patch-clamp experiments\nand SOCE in intact cells is that the latter manifests itself as a transient increase in [Ca2+]i\n(Fig. 6), whereas whole-cell recordings exhibit a more persistent CRAC current that is\nfollowed by an even larger, secondary activation of CRAC channel activity (Fig. 3A, C, F).\nThe transient nature of STIM2-mediated SOCE in intact cells may also explain why the\nstore-operated mechanism remained undetected in typical assays of SOCE (14, 16), where\nthapsigargin-induced store depletion in zero extracellular Ca2+ is followed by Ca2+\nreadmission after several hundreds of seconds to probe SOCE.

We therefore examined whether STIM2 can\nserve as a Ca2+ sensor and activate CRAC channels in a store-dependent manner when\nSTIM1 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNA (siRNA). We confirmed the\nefficacy of siRNA treatment in wild-type (wt) HEK293 cells, where endogenous CRAC\ncurrents were almost completely suppressed after siRNA treatment (Fig. 3E). However, in\nparallel experiments performed in STIM2- and CRACM1-expressing cells, STIM1\nknockdown did not significantly affect the bi-phasic CRAC currents (Fig. 3F), suggesting\nthat STIM2 has the intrinsic ability to respond to store depletion. We surmised that the Ca2+-\nsensing function of STIM2 might be mediated by an EF-hand motif located in the N\nterminus of the protein facing the lumen of the ER, since such a motif is also found in\nSTIM1 and has been shown to serve this function (8, 17, 27). To test this idea, we\nintroduced a point mutation into the EF-hand motif of the STIM2 protein (D80A) that would\nbe predicted to disrupt Ca2+ binding. The equivalent mutation in STIM1 (D76A) has been\nshown to abolish its Ca2+-sensing function and results in constitutive activation of SOCE (8,\n17, 27). As illustrated in Fig. 3F, the D80A mutant of STIM2 failed to support the rapid,\nstore-operated activation phase of CRAC channels, whereas the delayed, store-independent\nactivation phase remained unaffected.

When the\nbath KCl concentration, initially 140 mM, was changed to 210 mM and\n70 mM, the reversal potentials were changed to +6.29 \u00b1 0.82 mV and\n\u221211.46 \u00b1 1.09 mV (n = 8), respectively (Fig. 3C). The reversal po-\ntentials were plotted as a function of extracellular KCl concentration on\na semi-logarithmic scale. A line was \ufb01tted to +37.2 mV/decade, which\nis relatively close to +58 mV/decade of the Nernst equation when the\nmajor carrier charge is a cation. The relative permeability ratio of K+\n(PCl/PK) calculated by Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation [41] is\nand Cl\n0.237 \u00b1 0.034, suggesting a weak permeability to Cl\n. Thus, these\nresults clearly suggest that ANO9 exhibits a large preference for cations.\nWe then explored the selectivity among cations by estimating the\npermeability ratios after replacing the 140 mM KCl solution in the bath\nwith a solution of 70 mM CaCl2 and 140 mM of NaCl, CsCl, and LiCl.\nThe pipette solution contained 140 mM KCl. The reversal potentials\nwere \u22122.07 \u00b1 1.56, \u22127.83 \u00b1 1.25, \u22121.06 \u00b1 2.43\nand\n\u221212.6 \u00b1 2.96 mV when the bath K+ solution was changed to Ca2+,\nCs+, Na+, and Li+, respectively (Fig. 3D). The relative permeability\nratios (PX/PK) ranged from 0.54 to 1.87 (Fig. 3E), suggesting that ANO9\ndiscriminated poorly among cations but was more permeable to Ca2+\nthan to monovalent cations.",

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4).

When the\nbath KCl concentration, initially 140 mM, was changed to 210 mM and\n70 mM, the reversal potentials were changed to +6.29 \u00b1 0.82 mV and\n\u221211.46 \u00b1 1.09 mV (n = 8), respectively (Fig. 3C). The reversal po-\ntentials were plotted as a function of extracellular KCl concentration on\na semi-logarithmic scale. A line was \ufb01tted to +37.2 mV/decade, which\nis relatively close to +58 mV/decade of the Nernst equation when the\nmajor carrier charge is a cation. The relative permeability ratio of K+\n(PCl/PK) calculated by Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation [41] is\nand Cl\n0.237 \u00b1 0.034, suggesting a weak permeability to Cl\n. Thus, these\nresults clearly suggest that ANO9 exhibits a large preference for cations.\nWe then explored the selectivity among cations by estimating the\npermeability ratios after replacing the 140 mM KCl solution in the bath\nwith a solution of 70 mM CaCl2 and 140 mM of NaCl, CsCl, and LiCl.\nThe pipette solution contained 140 mM KCl. The reversal potentials\nwere \u22122.07 \u00b1 1.56, \u22127.83 \u00b1 1.25, \u22121.06 \u00b1 2.43\nand\n\u221212.6 \u00b1 2.96 mV when the bath K+ solution was changed to Ca2+,\nCs+, Na+, and Li+, respectively (Fig. 3D). The relative permeability\nratios (PX/PK) ranged from 0.54 to 1.87 (Fig. 3E), suggesting that ANO9\ndiscriminated poorly among cations but was more permeable to Ca2+\nthan to monovalent cations.",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal\nvoltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =\n47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is\nshallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately\n1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).\nBased on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that\nTRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-\nment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and\nTRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25\u2013\n28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)\nstructurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions",

This conformational change is preceded by\nmovement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage\nsensors\u2014a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical\nimpulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low\nopen probability with voltage stimulation alone and require\nspecific ligand interactions or other stimuli\nto fully open.\nStructural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML\nchannels suggest\ntheir VSD-like domains form ligand\nbinding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation\n(41\u201345). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical\nmechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic\nmediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in\ngeneral, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-\nered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that\nTRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-\nlated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial\ngating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD\nappears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel\nopening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our\nRosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in\nconjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-\ncystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in\nVGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural\nfeatures of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix\nmodels (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-\nrangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 \u00c5 across\nthe membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise\ncounter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar\nand electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same\ntime, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-\ntracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-\ndues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is\nactivated (48).",

Oxida-\ntive cross-linking (38) of designed double-cysteine mutants was\nexpected to restrain the conformation of the voltage-sensitive\nhelix TM4 relative to other adjacent transmembrane helix (e.g.,\nTM1, TM5, and TM6) upon disulfide formation, and thus lock\nthe channel in a closed state (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the V127C/\nT217C (TM4\u2013TM6) pair mutants resulted in a small but non-\nnegligible shift in the SDS/PAGE upon CuP-promoted oxida-\ntion, indicating interhelical disulfide formation of C127/C217\nwithin the protomer (Fig. 6D). Just as expected, the V127C/\nT217C double mutant does not show any channel opening, even\nat voltages higher than +50 mV, most likely because the C127/\nC217 disulfide bond locks the voltage-sensing TM4 helix in a\nrestrained conformation, thus causing the channel to remain\nclosed upon depolarization. Reduction of the disulfide bond\nwith DTT leads to robust channel opening (Fig. 6E). Other\npairs of mutants [F25C/V125C (TM1\u2013TM4) and A137C/T151C\n(TM4\u2013TM5)] did not show any obvious shift in the cross-linking\nanalysis or different electrophysiological responses between ox-\nidizing and reducing conditions.

                    "text": "ClC-1 is the closest mammalian ortholog of the electric\norgan chloride channel ClC-0. The general properties of\nheterologously expressed ClC-1 channels are in agreement\nwith those of the skeletal muscle Cl(cid:2) conductance (83, 617,\n807). However, before the cloning of ClC-1, the skeletal\nmuscle Cl(cid:2) conductance had been studied mostly using cur-\nrent-clamp recordings of skeletal muscle \ufb01bers, which does\nnot allow a precise determination of biophysical parameters\n(83). Recently, whole cell patch-clamp recordings and two-\nelectrode voltage-clamp recordings have shown that the\nproperties of the endogenous conductance are practically\nidentical to that of heterologously expressed ClC-1 chan-\nnels (196, 496, 497). Like this prototype channel, it shows\na typical \u201cdouble-barreled\u201d electrophysiological \ufb01ngerprint\nwith two equally spaced, independent conduction levels\n(739). However, since its single-channel conductance is\n~1.5 pS, as \ufb01rst determined by noise analysis (678) and later\ncon\ufb01rmed by single-channel recordings (739, 814, 894,\n897), much lower than that of ClC-0 (~10 pS) (50, 548), it\nis technically more challenging to measure single-channel\ncurrents of ClC-1. Moreover, compared with ClC-0, it is\nmore dif\ufb01cult to distinguish between common gating (that\naffects both pores of the dimeric channel) and protopore\ngating (that affects only one pore). Whereas the common\ngate activates ClC-0 very slowly (within seconds) upon hy-\nperpolarization, the protopore gate is fast (in the 10 ms\nrange) and opens upon depolarization. In contrast, both the\ncommon and protopore gates open upon depolarization\nand do not show drastic differences in gating kinetics at\nphysiological voltages with slow and fast time constants\nthat differ by less than roughly a factor of 5 and are smaller\nthan 100 ms (8, 720, 721, 739). Hence, more sophisticated\nanalysis is needed to distinguish both gates in ClC-1 (8,\n739), which can be affected differentially by myotonic mu-\ntations. The voltage dependence of both gates contributes\nto the outward recti\ufb01cation of macroscopic currents. ClC-1\nis ~40% open at resting voltages of skeletal muscle (894)\nand can be opened further by depolarization. It displays a\n(cid:2) (cid:5) I(cid:2) selectivity sequence (722) that is\nCl(cid:2) (cid:5) Br(cid:2) (cid:5) NO3\ntypical for CLC channels.",

Mutation of this residue to Arg, to reverse the\ncharge, completely abolished CALHM1 ion currents (Fig. 1F).\nThese results indicate that D121 contributes not only to Ca2+\nselectivity, but also to the conductance pathway for other ions.\nTogether, these results demonstrate that CALHM1 itself forms\na unique plasma membrane ion channel and suggest that the\nextracellular end of putative TM3 lines the CALHM1 ion pore.",

A\ncardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents\nactivated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion\nflow during the transition from the open to closed states in the\nwhole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly\nfound in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have\npreviously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29\u201331). In the\nsymmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-\ncell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-\nate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a\nBoltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A).

                    "text": "Recent structures of isolated full-length GluA and GluK receptors in different functional \nstates have established that iGluR gating is accompanied by complex ATD-LBD relative \nmotions (26, 36, 37). Furthermore, desensitization of GluA receptors results in a marked \nconformational variability in the ATD layer (4, 26, 36). Similar motions might, in principle, \nbe possible in GluD receptors, considering their overall structural and sequence homology to \nGluA and GluK family members. However, we propose that, in a trans-synaptic context, \nanchoring of GluD to the \u03b2-NRX1(+4)\u2013Cbln1 complex will limit or prevent large-scale \nmotions of the ATD layer. As a result, the force generated by LBD closure, driving the \noverall receptor contraction, is likely to transfer predominantly towards the post-synaptic \nmembrane. Since most, if not all, iGluR family members are anchored to synaptic cleft \nproteins via their ATDs (16\u201320), it is conceivable that their range of motions may also differ \nfrom those currently described in isolated receptors (4, 26, 36). Such interactions will impact \non both iGluR location and conformation in response to agonist binding. We propose that \nthe concept illustrated here, where small molecule and protein ligands cooperate in order to \nmodulate GluD2 signaling, is likely to be more generally applicable to neurotransmitter \nreceptors.",
