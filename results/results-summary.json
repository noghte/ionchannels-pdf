Here, we found that NALCN, when co-expressed with UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155, exhibits an unusual modulation by membrane voltage (Fig. 1). This highlights how voltage sensor domains can, depending on the context, contribute to gating in previously unanticipated ways and thus contributes to our understanding of how this widely encountered motif can modulate ion channel function (37). We show that the voltage dependence originates from positively charged residues in the S4 segments of DI and DII of NALCN, as charge-neutralizing substitutions affected voltage sensitivity (Fig. 4)."

Store-dependent activation can be demonstrated both in patch-clamp experiments when cells are perfused with InsP3 (Fig. 3A) or when store depletion is caused by ionomycin (Fig. 3C), which both result in rapid activation of CRAC currents. SOCE is also evident in [Ca2+]i imaging experiments in intact cells when cells are stimulated with an InsP3-mobilizing agonist and blocking store refilling with thapsigargin (Fig. 6). The main difference between CRAC in patch-clamp experiments and SOCE in intact cells is that the latter manifests itself as a transient increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6), whereas whole-cell recordings exhibit a more persistent CRAC current that is followed by an even larger, secondary activation of CRAC channel activity (Fig. 3A, C, F)."

To address this question, we first performed ion substitution experiments. We observed no change in the magnitude of the currents when the concentrations of either Na+ or Cl- in the extracellular solution were changed (Figure 2A), indicating that OTOP2 is not permeable to either ion. We also measured the reversal potential of OTOP2 currents as a function of \u0394pH (pHo \u2013 pHi) under conditions designed to minimize H+ ion accumulation (see methods) (Cherny and DeCoursey, 1999; Ramsey et al., 2006; Tu et al., 2018). These experiments showed that Erev changed ~59 mV/pH as expected for an H+- selective ion channel (Figure 2B). Thus, we conclude that OTOP2 is selective for protons."
