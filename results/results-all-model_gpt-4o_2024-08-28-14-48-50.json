A predicted transmembrane domain (TMD)\nnear the N-terminus of CLIC4 could mediate membrane insertion, and contribute to oligomeric pores, with minimal\nreorganization of the soluble protein structure. We tested this idea by reconstituting recombinant CLIC4 in planar bilayers\ncontaining phosphatidyethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, recording ion channels with a maximum\nconductance of (cid:1)/15 pS in KCl under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The channels discriminated poorly\nbetween anions and cations, incompatible with the current ‘‘CLIC’’ nomenclature, and their conductance was modified by\nthe trans (external or luminal) redox potential, as previously observed for CLIC1. We then reconstituted a truncated version\nof the protein, limited to the first 61 residues containing the predicted TMD. This included a single trans cysteine residue in\nthe putative pore-forming subunits, at the external entrance to the pore. The truncated protein formed non-selective\nchannels with a reduced conductance, but they retained their trans -redox sensitivity, and could still be blocked or\ninactivated by trans (not cis ) thiol-reative dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid. We suggest that oligomers containing the putative\nTMD are essential components of the CLIC4 pore. However, the pore is inherently non-selective, and any ionic selectivity\nin CLIC4 (and other membrane CLICs) may be attributable to other regions of the protein, including the channel\nvestibules.",

We have identiﬁed two\nnovel human serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor-like genes, HTR3D and HTR3E, by performing homology searches using the\npublic human sequence databases and subsequently cloned the full length cDNAs by 50 and 30 rapid ampliﬁcation of complementary DNA\nends. Mapping of HTR3D and HTR3E by hybridisation, polymerase chain reaction and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridisation revealed that both\ngenes together with HTR3C are clustered in a subinterval of less than 100 kb on chromosome 3q27. Comparative expression analysis of all\nHTR3 genes, namely HTR3A, B, C, D and E showed HTR3D expression to be restricted to kidney, colon and liver and HTR3E expression to\ncolon and intestine, whereas all other genes are widely expressed in many tissues including brain.\nq 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
