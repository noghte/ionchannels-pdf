Kv1.3 is one of eight members of the mammalian Kv1 family of
Kv channels and the only one expressed on human T cells1,4,17,18.
The Kv1 channels are tetramers and each subunit has a large
cytoplasmic domain called T1, and six transmembrane helices
called S1-S6, with S1-S4 forming a voltage-sensing domain (VSD)
and S5-S6 forming the ion conducting pore domain19–23. The S5-
S6 region harbors the P-loop, which in turn contains the highly
conserved selectivity ﬁlter responsible for coordinating K+ ions
and maintaining K+ permeation24. The selectivity ﬁlter contains
the TXGYG motif which is highly conserved in potassium
channels and is known as the potassium channel signature
sequence25. The ﬁlter is structured with the backbone carbonyls
of the signature sequence directed into the pore along the four-
fold symmetry axis of the channel26. The structure formed by the
carbonyls is evolved to precisely coordinate dehydrated K+ ions
and select for potassium over sodium27. Structures of potassium
channels most commonly show the selectivity ﬁlter coordinating
up to four K+ ions with additional K+ ions in the cavity below
the ﬁlter, or situated above the ﬁlter19,21,24,26. The four S6 helices
in a tetramer come together on the intracellular side of the
membrane to form the internal gate. The gate is closed when the
cell
is at rest but upon membrane depolarization the VSDs
undergo a conformational change that opens the gate and allows
K+ ion efﬂux28–30.

Query 2: Does this article provide evidence for `voltage-gated` as the gating mechanism for the `K_V` ion channel?
Results 2: Response: 1. 'answer': Yes
2. 'confidence': 0.9
3. 'evidence': The article discusses the voltage dependence of Kv3 channels and how shifting the midpoint of activation in the depolarized direction affects their function, indicating a voltage-gated mechanism.

****Metadata****
Sources: [{'pubmed': None, 'text': 'The evidence discussed in this article suggests that the voltage\ndependence and deactivation rates of Kv3 channels represent an\nadaptation that specifically enables fast and complete\nrepolarization of action potentials, and allows short interspike\nintervals. Shifting the midpoint (V1/2) of activation in the\ndepolarized direction, as occurs on Kv3 channels, not only\nminimizes the current during rest and during the spike upstroke\nbut it also produces fast closing rates because, for channels\nobeying Boltzmann kinetics, the rates of transition between states\nbecome faster as the voltage moves away from V1/2 – the\nequilibrium point. In Kv3 channels, the resting voltage (approx. −\n70 mV) is far (about 85 mV) away from V1/2 (approx. +15 mV), so\nthe rate of closure is maximized.'}, {'pubmed': None, 'text': 'K+ conduction and selectivity.

Context Text: The evidence discussed in this article suggests that the voltage
dependence and deactivation rates of Kv3 channels represent an
adaptation that specifically enables fast and complete
repolarization of action potentials, and allows short interspike
intervals. Shifting the midpoint (V1/2) of activation in the
depolarized direction, as occurs on Kv3 channels, not only
minimizes the current during rest and during the spike upstroke
but it also produces fast closing rates because, for channels
obeying Boltzmann kinetics, the rates of transition between states
become faster as the voltage moves away from V1/2 – the
equilibrium point. In Kv3 channels, the resting voltage (approx. −
70 mV) is far (about 85 mV) away from V1/2 (approx. +15 mV), so
the rate of closure is maximized.

DISCUSSION
There are several reports supporting a significant contribution of counte-
rion conductance to Golgi acidification20,24, whereas other recent studies 
and models have indicated a smaller significance of counterion conduct-
ance for the maintenance of Golgi pH compared to intrinsic proton 
leakage19,21–23. We established mutant cells with an elevated Golgi pH and 
identified GPHR as the gene responsible for this defect. As the elevated 
pH in the mutant cells caused impaired trafficking and glycosylation of

the Golgi, GPHR is crucial for facilitating sufficient luminal acidification 
for normal Golgi functions. The GPHR gene encodes a Golgi-resident 
anion  channel,  suggesting  that  the  function  of  GPHR  is  counterion

Context Text: Results
TRPP2 and VGICs Share a Voltage-Dependent Gating Mechanism. A
cardinal feature of voltage-gated channels are large tail currents
activated by membrane repolarization, which capture the ion
flow during the transition from the open to closed states in the
whole-cell patch configuration. This feature is not commonly
found in TRP channels; however, we and several groups have
previously shown that TRPP2 is an exception (29–31). In the
symmetrical sodium conditions devoid of divalent ions, whole-
cell patched HEK293T cells overexpressing this channel gener-
ate robust tail currents upon repolarization and can be fit to a
Boltzmann function (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The half-maximal
voltage dependence of TRPP2 activation is positive (V1/2 =
47 mV), and the slope of the current voltage relationship is
shallow (Z = 1.1), which infers a transfer of approximately
1 gating charge per channel subunit (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Based on these functional characteristics, we hypothesized that
TRPP2 channel proteins likely contain a voltage sensing ele-
ment. Several high-resolution structures of TRPP1 and
TRPP2 have been determined by single partial cryo-EM (20, 25–
28), and their conserved S4 lysines (K452 and K455 in TRPP2)
structurally align to the third and fourth gating charge positions

37 mV more negative than channel opening. The TRPP2 gating
current is one-fourth the size of those measured from voltage-
gated Nav, Cav, and Kv channels. This is expected since TRPP2
has fewer gating charges than are found within typical VGIC
voltage sensors (2 vs. 4 to 6 charges per voltage sensor). We
demonstrate that preservation of both K3 and K4 gating charge
positions is essential for the function of both TRPP2 and a
typical VGIC, NaChBac. These results are supported by muta-
genesis studies in the Shaker Kv channel, where the number of
gating charges could not be reduced beyond positions K3 and K4
(49). With few exceptions, TRP channels do not have gating
charges within their VSD. The cold-sensitive TRPM8 channel
has a single positively charged residue at gating charge position
K4 (44). While there is significant functional evidence that
TRPM8 currents are voltage dependent, there are no reports of
gating currents measured from TRPM8 channels. In addition,
neutralizing the putative gating charge alters voltage and thermal
sensitivity but does not abolish the ionic conductance entirely
(50). Thus, it appears that TRPM8 can still function without a
gating charge, an indication that its activation mechanism is
different from that of TRPP2 and VGICs. In this study, we have
shown that TRPP2 channels can be potentiated by osmotic
membrane swelling and heat. However, these stimuli potentiate
the TRPP2 current using distinct mechanisms. We find that
membrane swelling reduces the membrane potential required to
move the gating charge and enhances its open probability at
negative membrane potentials. This is achieved by increasing the
voltage sensitivity of the gating charges in the VSD. In contrast,
heat enhances TRPP2 unitary ion conductance, a parameter
controlled by the PD. Future work will be directed at a structural
mechanism showing how the VSD activation integrates the
membrane tension to alter TRPP2’s voltage-dependent activa-
tion. Importantly, all polymodal means of activating TRPP2 fail
to open the channel when 1 of the gating charges is neutralized.

Discussion
VGICs and TRPP2 Channel Opening Requires Activation of the VSD.
VGICs open their ion conducting pores in response to changes in
membrane potential. This conformational change is preceded by
movement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage
sensors—a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical
impulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low
open probability with voltage stimulation alone and require
specific ligand interactions or other stimuli
to fully open.
Structural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML
channels suggest
their VSD-like domains form ligand
binding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation
(41–45). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical
mechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic
mediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in
general, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-
ered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that
TRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-
lated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial
gating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD
appears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel
opening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our
Rosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in
conjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-
cystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in
VGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural
features of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix
models (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-
rangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 Å across
the membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise
counter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar
and electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same
time, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-
tracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-
dues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is
activated (48).

contains rings of arginine or lysine residues (as
suggested in Figure 9), transient binding of per-
meant anions could provide an opportunity for
counter ions (e.g., K(cid:1)) to cross the membrane
without encountering a prohibitive positive charge.
In a scheme like this, ion permeation requires the
presence of anions, and they must be sufficiently
small to penetrate the pore. Large,
impermeant
anions would prevent the passage of both anions
and cations (regardless of the latter’s size), whereas
large, relatively impermeant cations would not pre-
vent all ion permeation, but would make the channel
more anion-selective. Consistent with this idea, we
noted enhanced anion vs. cation selectivity in the
presence of the relatively large cation Tris(cid:1) com-
pared to K(cid:1). We also noted that CLIC4 was unable
to discriminate between a range of different anions,
again consistent with the idea that the pore itself is
poorly-selective. However, CLIC1 is slightly but
measurably more anion-selective than CLIC4 [23],
so if the putative pore-lining is not responsible for
this difference (and the sequences are very similar, as
shown in Figure 9, suggesting in passing that
detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies of putative
TMD/pore-lining residues may not be very produc-

In contrast to CLIC1, relatively little is known
about CLIC4-associated ion channels. Although the
incorporation of microsomal membrane vesicles
containing recombinant CLIC4 into planar lipid
bilayers gave rise to novel anion channel activity of
10(cid:2)50 pS [9], this could have been due to the
activation of unidentified endogenous channels,
especially since another CLIC, CLIC2, has been
shown to be a channel modulator rather than an ion
channel itself [22]. CLIC4 (possibly with the short
C-terminal extension required for crystallisation)
gave rise to channel activity in ‘‘tip-dip’’ bilayers
[12], but
the channel was
unclear
(reported as both 31 pS and 57 pS).
Novel
ion channels specifically shown to contain
FLAG-tagged CLIC4 have also been recorded by
patch-clamping the plasma membrane of cells over-
expressing the protein [19]. In the presence of large
cations (to limit endogenous cation currents), the
channels
conductance
appeared to be very low, of the order of 1 pS.
Currents through CLIC1 are now known to be
regulated by the external redox potential [23], and if

idea that a Cl(cid:2), coming from the inside, displaces the neg-
atively charged gating glutamate, which is then stabilized by
voltage-independent protonation from the outside in the
open conﬁgurations (166, 730, 731). A strong argument of

tion by mild acidic pH is most likely mediated by the pro-
tonation of the gating glutamate of ClC-2 (587). However,
a major question is if the primary, voltage-dependent event,
driving the displacement of the gating glutamate from its
blocking position is a movement of a Cl(cid:2) from the inside,
pushing the glutamate side towards the outside, or a H(cid:3),
protonating the gating glutamate from the outside. Ni-
emeyer et al. (587) found that the apparent pK of acidiﬁca-

Context Text: The evidence discussed in this article suggests that the voltage
dependence and deactivation rates of Kv3 channels represent an
adaptation that specifically enables fast and complete
repolarization of action potentials, and allows short interspike
intervals. Shifting the midpoint (V1/2) of activation in the
depolarized direction, as occurs on Kv3 channels, not only
minimizes the current during rest and during the spike upstroke
but it also produces fast closing rates because, for channels
obeying Boltzmann kinetics, the rates of transition between states
become faster as the voltage moves away from V1/2 – the
equilibrium point. In Kv3 channels, the resting voltage (approx. −
70 mV) is far (about 85 mV) away from V1/2 (approx. +15 mV), so
the rate of closure is maximized.

ABSTRACT
Within the family of serotonin receptors, the 5-hydroxytrypta-
mine-3 (5-HT3) receptor is the only ligand-gated ion channel. It
is composed of five subunits, of which the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B
subunits are best characterized. Several studies, however,
have reported on the functional diversity of native 5-HT3 recep-
tors, which cannot solely be explained on the basis of the
5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits. After our discovery of further
putative 5-HT3 serotonin receptor-encoding genes, HTR3C,
HTR3D, and HTR3E, we investigated whether these novel can-
didates and the isoform 5-HT3Ea are able to form functional
5-HT3 receptor complexes. Using immunofluorescence and im-
munoprecipitation studies of heterologously expressed pro-
teins, we found that each of the respective candidates coas-
sembles with 5-HT3A. To investigate whether the novel subunits
modulate 5-HT3 receptor function, we performed radioligand-
binding assays and calcium-influx studies in human embryonic

species. Different ligand binding afﬁnities and ion channel
conductances of diverse tissues and cell lines have been
reported and pharmacologic proﬁles of homomeric and
heteromeric receptors showed differences in the properties
of the respective receptors. Only 5-HT3A subunits can form
functional homo-oligomeric complexes after expression in
Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells, whereas the 5-HT3B
subunits are not able to build a functional receptor on their
own (Miyake et al., 1995; Davies et al., 1999; Dubin et al.,
1999). Recombinant homo-oligomeric 5-HT3A receptors
show extremely reduced channel conductances compared to
native receptors, whereas heteromeric complexes composed
of both 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits resemble closely the
properties of the native receptors (Davies et al., 1999).
Variable receptor compositions have also been shown by
Western blot experiments which led to the hypothesis that
further 5-HT3 receptor subunits actually should exist
(McKernan, 1992; Hussy et al., 1994; Jackson and Yakel,
1995; Fletcher and Barnes, 1998). To verify this hypothesis
we have established a 5-HT3 receptor consensus sequence to
screen databases and identiﬁed a human BAC clone (RP11-
315J22) harbouring additional subunit sequences. We
established primers and cloned the entire coding region of
two novel HTR3-homologous genes by 50 and 30 RACE:
HTR3D and HTR3E. Mapping data of HTR3D and HTR3E
and of the recently cloned HTR3C gene (accession number
AF459285) revealed that they all reside in close vicinity on
chromosome 3q27. To get a better insight into the putative
role of HTR3D and HTR3E, we carried out expression
analysis and compared the expression proﬁles to those of
HTR3A, B and C.

Context Text: The evidence discussed in this article suggests that the voltage
dependence and deactivation rates of Kv3 channels represent an
adaptation that specifically enables fast and complete
repolarization of action potentials, and allows short interspike
intervals. Shifting the midpoint (V1/2) of activation in the
depolarized direction, as occurs on Kv3 channels, not only
minimizes the current during rest and during the spike upstroke
but it also produces fast closing rates because, for channels
obeying Boltzmann kinetics, the rates of transition between states
become faster as the voltage moves away from V1/2 – the
equilibrium point. In Kv3 channels, the resting voltage (approx. −
70 mV) is far (about 85 mV) away from V1/2 (approx. +15 mV), so
the rate of closure is maximized.

Introduction
When ion channels open in response to a given stimulus, they allow the flow of a specific set of ions.
The textbook view is that ion selectivity for a given ion channel is a hallmark feature that cannot be
changed. But evidence has accrued suggesting that this may not always be the case. P2X receptors
have long been proposed to change their ion selectivity in real time upon prolonged activation
(Khakh and Lester, 1999) albeit controversially (Li et al., 2015). And in TRPV channels, the selectiv-
ity filter is thought to form a second gate thereby coupling channel opening with changes in ion
selectivity (Cao et al., 2013). Other channels such as Orai channels (McNally et al., 2012) and the
mitochondrial uniporter MCU1 (Kamer et al., 2018) appear to alter their ion selectivity depending
on protein partners.

is large and functionally diverse, as exemplified by a wide
range of physiological and pharmacological modulators, differ-
ences in ion selectivity, and tissue and subcellular distributions.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) and its close
homolog TRPV6 are unique among all TRP channels because of
their high selectivity for calcium over monovalent cations (PCa/
PNa >100:1) (1). They are also distinct from other members of
the vanilloid subfamily (TRPV1–4) in that they are not known to
be thermosensitive or ligand-activated (2, 3). Physiologically, TRPV5
and TRPV6 serve as apical entryways into epithelial cells that line
segments of the intestine and kidney, initiating transcellular cal-
cium transport that helps fine-tune serum calcium levels (4).
Disturbances in the body’s calcium balance can cause major health
including neurologic and cardiac aberrations, stone
problems,
formation, and bone disorders (5–7). Indeed, genetic variants of
TRPV5 are associated with altered renal calcium handling and
increased risk of recurrent kidney stones (8–10).

Discussion
VGICs and TRPP2 Channel Opening Requires Activation of the VSD.
VGICs open their ion conducting pores in response to changes in
membrane potential. This conformational change is preceded by
movement of 3 to 4 gating charges from each of their S4 voltage
sensors—a step that is crucial for their regulation of electrical
impulses in excitable cells (6). Most TRP channels have a low
open probability with voltage stimulation alone and require
specific ligand interactions or other stimuli
to fully open.
Structural analysis of TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPML
channels suggest
their VSD-like domains form ligand
binding sites but the S4 remains relatively static during activation
(41–45). For several TRP channel subtypes, the biophysical
mechanism of current rectification is achieved through extrinsic
mediators, like divalent cation block of TRPM7 (17, 18). Thus, in
general, members of the TRP channel families are not consid-
ered intrinsically voltage sensitive. In this paper, we show that
TRPP2 channels (and possibly TRPP1) are intrinsically regu-
lated by membrane potential through the function of 2 crucial
gating charges (K3 and K4). For TRPP2, activation of the VSD
appears to be the rate-limiting step and requisite for channel
opening, regardless of polymodal stimuli. Results from our
Rosetta modeling of TRPP2 channel in open and closed states in
conjunction with our functional data support a model of poly-
cystin opening that shares hallmark structural features found in
VGICs. The consensus view of VGIC gating adopts structural
features of the previously proposed transporter and sliding helix
models (46, 47). The VSD undergoes voltage-dependent rear-
rangements where the S4 segment translocates 3 to 8 Å across
the membrane electric field, and gating charges form stepwise
counter charge and hydrogen bond interactions between polar
and electronegative residues of the VSD (11, 13). At the same
time, water-exposed crevasse within the VSD is formed on ex-
tracellular side of the membrane, where previously buried resi-
dues are exposed to the aqueous environment when the sensor is
activated (48).
